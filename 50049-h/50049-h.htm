<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">King René d’Anjou and his Seven Queens</span>&mdash;yes,
I stand by my title, and offer no apology to the
captious and the curious.</p>

<p>René was the most remarkable personality in the
French Renaissance. How many English readers of
the romance of history, I wonder, know anything about
him but his name? Of his “seven Queens,” two only
are at all familiar to the English public,&mdash;Marguerite
d’Anjou and Jeanne d’Arc,&mdash;and their stories as
commonly told are unconvincing. The other five are
not known even by name to the majority of people;
therefore I have immense pleasure in introducing
them to any clientèle: Yolanda d’Arragona, Isabelle
de Lorraine, Jehanne de Laval, Giovanna II. da
Napoli, Jeanne d’Arc and Marguerite d’Anjou.
This galaxy of Queens, fair and frail, will appeal as
something entirely new in sentimental biography
to those in search of novelty.</p>

<p>Turgid facts of history and dryasdust statistics of
the past are, of course, within everybody’s ken, or
they are supposed to be&mdash;this is an age of snobbery!
Piquant stories of the persons and foibles of famous
men and women are my measure, and such you will
have in plenty in my narratives. To get at my facts
and fictions I have dug deep into the records of Court
chroniclers, and I think I have blended very successfully
the spirit of the troubadours and the spirit of
the age of chivalry. At the end of the volume I
have added a Bibliography, for the benefit of
sententious students, and my Index is as full as po<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>ssible,
to assist the casual reader.</p>

<p>The illustrations which adorn my pages have
been gathered from many sources. I think they
will greatly assist the appreciation of my work. With
respect to portraits of my “Queens,” there are no
extant likenesses of Yolanda and Jeanne: for the
latter I have chosen to reproduce the historical
imaginative fresco of M. Lepenveu, at the Pantheon
in Paris; for the former the stained-glass window effigy
at Le Mans Cathedral must do duty. Queen Isabelle
is an enlargement of a miniature by René; Queen
Marie is after a French picture of the School of
Jean Focquet, now at the National Gallery, London,
but wrongly entitled. Queen Giovanna II. is from
an altar-piece in the National Museum at Naples.
Queen Marguerite is from a miniature by her father,&mdash;her
portraits in England are eminently unsatisfactory
and non-contemporary,&mdash;Queen Jehanne is from the
right wing of the Aix triptych, by Nicholas Froment.</p>

<p>There is, I think, nothing more to add to my preface,
so I leave “King René and his Seven Queens” <i>tête-à-tête</i>
with my discerning public. If they are found to
be entertaining company I am repaid.</p>

<h1>KING RENÉ D’ANJOU AND HIS<br />
SEVEN QUEENS</h1>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">INTRODUCTORY</span></h2>

<p>“René, King of Jerusalem, the Two Sicilies, Aragon,
Valencia, Majorca, Sardinia and Corsica; Duke of
Anjou, Barrois, and Lorraine; Count of Provence,
Forcalquier and Piemont,” so runs the preamble of
his Will. To these titles he might have added
Prince of Gerona, Duke of Calabria, Lord of Genoa,
Count of Guise, Maine, Chailly, and Longjumeau,
and Marquis of Pont-à-Mousson!</p>

<p>He was famous as a Sovereign, a soldier, a legislator,
a traveller, a linguist, a scholar, a poet, a
musician, a craftsman, a painter, an architect, a
sculptor, a collector, a sportsman, an agriculturist, and
incidentally a chivalrous lover. About such a many-sided
character there is much to tell and much to
learn. His times were spacious; the clouds of Mediævalism
had rolled away, and the Sun of Progress illuminated
the heyday of the Renaissance; art and craft
had come into their own. Venus disarmed Mars, Diana
entranced Apollo, and Minerva restrained Mercury,
and all the hierarchy of heaven was captive to the
Liberal Arts. René d’Anjou, figuratively, seems to
have gathered up in his cunning hand the powers of
all the spiritual intelligences alongwith the life-lines
of practical manifestations. He has come down to us
as the beau-ideal Prince of the fifteenth century.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p>“A Prince who had great and pre-eminent
qualities, worthy of a better future. He was a great
Justicier and an enemy to long despatches. He
said sometimes, when they presented anything to
signe, being a-hunting or at the warre, that the Pen
was a kinde of Armes, which a person should use at
all times”&mdash;so wrote the historian Pierre Mathieu,
in his “History of Louis XI.,” in 1614. He goes
on to say: “The reign of so good a Prince was
much lamented, for he intreated his subjects like a
Pastor and a Father. They say that when his
Treasurer brought unto him the Royale Taxe,&mdash;which
was sixteen florins for every kindled fire,
whereof Provence might have about three thousand
five hundred,&mdash;hee enformed himselfe of the aboundance
or barenesse of the season; and when they
told him, that a mistrall winde had reigned long, hee
remitted the moiety and sometimes the whole taxe.
Hee contented himself with his revenues, and did
not charge his people with new tributes. Hee spent
his time in paintings, the which were excellent, as
they are yet to be seen in the city of Aix. Hee
was drawing of a partridge when as they brought
him newes of the loose of the Realme of Naples, yet
hee could not draw his hande from the work and the
pleasure hee took here in.… They relate that
he dranke not wine, and when as the noble men
of Naples demanded the reasons, he affirmed that
it had made Titus Livius to lie, who had said that
the good wine caused the French to passe the
Alps.… He was perhaps better suited to
make a quiet State happy than to reduce a rebellious
one.”</p>

<p>King René’s career and work as a Sovereign, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
soldier, a legislator, a traveller, a poet, and a lover,
are treated in full in the letterpress of this volume.
His work as an artist, a craftsman, an agriculturist,
and a collector, is here given under different headings,
as introductory to the expression of his personal
talents.</p>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">Artistic Works of King René.</span></h3>

<p>René’s first efforts as a designer and painter were
exhibited upon the walls of his prison-chamber at
Tour de Bar, near Dijon, 1431-1435. Thence forward
he decorated the walls and stain-glazed the windows
of his various castles and palaces&mdash;Bar-le-Duc,
Nancy, Angers, Saumur, Reculée, Tarascon, Marseilles,
and Aix. Every <i>bastide</i> and <i>maison</i>
inhabited by his Queens and himself was also
similarly adorned, and many coloured church windows
were due to his gentle art. Alas that so few
vestiges of these admirable labours remain! French
mobs are proverbial for iconoclastic propensities, and no
land has suffered more than France from the
suicidal mania of her <i>sans-culottes</i>.</p>

<p>To fresco-painting, portraits, and glass-staining, the
Royal artist added miniatures and penmanship. His
“style” was formed and developed successively
under such personal tuition as that of the brothers
Van Eyck and Maistre Jehannot le Flament. Later
on Jean Focquet of Tours and Nicholas Froment
influenced him. A letter is extant of King René,
addressed in 1448 to Jan Van Eyck, in which he
asks for two good painters to be sent to Barrois.</p>

<p>Visits to Rome, Florence, Naples, Milan, and other
art cities of Italy, very greatly enlarged René’s
<i>métier</i>. Intercourse with Fra Angelico da <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>Fiesole,
Fra Filippo Lippi, Paolo Ucello, the Della Robbia,
and many other Tuscan artists, quickened his
natural talent and guided his eye and hand. Leon
Battista Alberti, Francesco Brunellesco, and Cennino
Cennini, and their works in <i>materia</i> and literature,
produced great results in the receptive faculties of
the King-artist. At Naples he came in contact
with Colantonio del Fiore, Antonio Solario&mdash;<i>Il
Zingaro</i>&mdash;and Angiolo Franco, and gathered up
what they taught.</p>

<p>Besides these immense advantages as a personal
friend of great ruling Italian families, the Medici,
the Pazzi, the Tornabuoni, the Visconti, the Sforza,
the Orsini, and many others, René had opportunities
enjoyed by very few. His own amiable
individuality and his ample knowledge were the
highest credentials in the pursuit of art and
craft. René witnessed the consecration of the
Duomo of Florence and the completion of the
guild shrine of Or San Michele, and he was
enrolled as an honorary member thereof. At
Florence also he was thrown in contact with world
famous <i>scrivani</i>&mdash;writers and illustrators of manuscript.
The subsequent excellence of French miniaturists
was largely due to King René’s example
and encouragement.</p>

<p>René’s more considerable paintings, which have
been preserved, are as follows:</p>

<p>1. <i>The Burning Bush</i>, part of an altar triptych,
at the Cathedral of Aix. Projected and begun by
the King, it was finished by Nicholas Froment, 1475-76,
and for it the artist received no more than 70
gulden (see illustration).</p>

<p>2. <i>Souls in Purgatory</i>, an altar-piece (7 × 5½),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
originally in hospital chapel at the Chartreuse of
Villeneuve les Avignon. It is really a “Judgment,”
with Christ and saints above the clouds, and twenty-four
little figures in and out torment. The building
was destroyed in 1793.</p>

<p>3. <i>La Divina Commedia</i>, an altar-piece (8 × 6),
in the church of the Célestins at Avignon in distemper.
It was due to René’s vision of his mistress, Dame
Chapelle, upon the day of her death, which shocked
him so greatly that he painted this composition to
remove the painful impression he thus experienced.</p>

<p>4. <i>Saint Madeleine preaching</i>, now in the
Hôtel Cluny. It was a whimsical conceit connecting
the story of the sisters of Lazarus with René and
his Queen Jehanne. It is conventional in treatment
but finished most beautifully (see illustration).</p>

<p>King René’s artistic speciality was miniatures.
He illuminated many manuscripts.</p>

<p>1. <i>Preces Præ</i>. The Latin “Hours” of King
René, a manuscript of 150 sheets of fine vellum,
written very beautifully in small lettering, with
superb capitals in gold and colours. The borders and
miniatures are exquisitely painted. It is bound in
red morocco. This precious volume was dedicated
to Queen Isabelle, whose portrait is painted as a
frontispiece (see illustration). It was one of the
King’s wedding presents to his second Queen, Jehanne
de Laval. The value of the <i>Preces Præ</i> is enhanced
by numerous marginal notes of dates and details
written by René’s hand. At the end by way of
<i>Finis</i> is a clock-face, upon which is painted “R et J,”
under the words “En Un,” all in a circle of gold. This
treasure is now in the National Library in Paris, and
there is a copy almost exactly in duplicate in the
Imperial Library in Vienna. The date is 1454.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <i>Pas d’Armes de la Bergère.</i> A poem of
Louis de Beauvau, Seigneur de la Roche et Champigny,
Grand Seneschal of Angers, Ambassador to Pope
Pius II., and a famous Champion in the “Lists.” It is a
pastoral allegory, and extols the courage and chivalry of
many famous knights&mdash;Ferri de Vaudémont, Philippe
Lenoncourt, Tanneguy de Chastel, Jean de Cossa,
Guy de Laval, and others. It was put forth in 1448
after the celebrated tournaments in Anjou, Lorraine,
and Provence. King René illuminated it with
portraits and miniature paintings at Tarascon, where
he and Jehanne de Laval spent so many happy days
ruralizing in 1457.</p>

<p>At Aix, in the Library, is a manuscript <i>Livres
des Heures</i>, dated 1458; at Avignon, in the Church
of the Cordeliers, is another of the following year;
at Poitiers, in the Library, is a “Psalter”; in the
Musée de l’Arsenal of Paris, a Breviary (see illustration)&mdash;all
exquisitely written and illuminated by
the master-hand of the King.</p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">Literary Works of King René.</span></h3>

<p>The earlier works of the King are sufficiently
remarkable as exhibiting his serenity in adversity
and his uprightness as a legislator; his later poems
are notable in revealing his chivalry as a knight-adventurer,
and his tenderness as a dainty troubadour.
René, whether as Sovereign, knight, or lover, led the
taste of his age. His personality attracted everybody,
and his character elevated all in fruitful
emulation. His utterances and his writings, in spite
of the freedom of manners and the piquancy of
speech, were conspicuous for chastity of t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>hought
and delicacy of expression. Not a single dubious
word or doubtful reference disfigures his pages: a
man and King was he without reproach.</p>

<p>The works which René composed as well as
decorated place him in the forefront of poets. The
principal are as follows:</p>

<p>1. <i>Regnault et Jehanneton</i>, or <i>Les Amours du
Bergier et de la Bergeronne</i>. It is an idyllic
pastoral. The manuscript occupies seventy sheets of
fine vellum, written in black and crimson, very carefully
and finely. The miniatures and capitals are very
numerous, and display the greatest skill and taste in
design and finish. This manuscript was written at
Tarascon, after René and Jehanne’s romantic sojourn
at his <i>bastide</i> on the Durance.</p>

<p>2. <i>Mortifiement de Vaine Plaisance</i>, or <i>Tracte
entre l’Ame devote et le Cœur</i>. In manuscript,
written very carefully in black and scarlet, with many
exquisitely-painted miniatures and capital letters.
This “Morality” covers fifty-five sheets of the
finest vellum. The Royal writer was assisted by
Jehan Coppre, a priest of Varronsgues. The frontispiece
by René represents the King, fully robed,
seated in his studio labouring with his pen and brush
(see illustration).</p>

<p>3. <i>La Conquête de la Doulce Mercy</i>, or <i>La
Conquête par le Cuer d’Amour Espris</i>. This is a manuscript
with 138 sheets of very smooth vellum written
in red, black, and purple, with sixty-two miniatures
and many capitals superbly painted. It is bound in
red morocco, and is in the National Library in Paris.
It bears the date 1457. René both wrote and illuminated
it shortly before the death of Queen Isabelle.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>4. <i>L’Abuzé en Court.</i> A manuscript covering
fifty-seven sheets of very fine vellum. Where and
how King René got his “skins” we do not know, but
they are the finest and most perfect of any French
or Italian manuscripts of the period. The colour and
grain of the skin are very fine; only an artist-writer
could have chosen such splendid folios. This manuscript
is bound in walnut-wood boards covered with
crimson velvet and embroidered. It contains fifty lovely
miniatures and has rich capitals. René has in this case
recorded the exact date of completion&mdash;July 12, 1473.</p>

<p>5. Very superb&mdash;perhaps King René’s <i>chef
d’œuvre</i>&mdash;is <i>Le Tracte des Tournois</i>, a full description
of his splendid tournament at Saumur, with the
richest possible illustration. It is dedicated to
Charles d’Anjou, his brother, who died in 1470; he
was Count of Maine and Guise, and Governor of
Lorraine. The frontispiece and two other illustrations
are reproductions of the Royal artist’s designs.</p>

<p>One of the most charming incidents in René’s long,
useful, and moving life was his intercourse with
Charles d’Anjou, son of the first Duke of Orléans,
brother of Charles VI. of France. The young Prince
was made a prisoner at the Battle of Agincourt in
1415, and remained in captivity in the Tower of
London for twenty-five years. His constant complaint
was: “I mourn with chagrin that no one
does anything to release me!” This piteous appeal
at length gained the heart of Duke Philippe of
Burgundy, who effected his deliverance in 1440.
Between King René and Duke Charles there passed,
through spiritual affinity, a constant succession of
delightful poetic souvenirs&mdash;the prisoner of La
Tour de Bar and the prisoner of the Tower of
London&mdash;comrades in sorrow, companions in joy!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
The form these missives took was that of <i>rondeaux</i>,
or valentines, and in this category nothing could be
more delicate and sensuous. A very favourite ending
of the poems was&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Après une seule excepter,</div>
<div class="verse">Je vous servirai cette conte,</div>
<div class="verse">Ma douce Valentine gente,</div>
<div class="verse">Puis qu’amour veuilt que on’y contente.”</div>
<div class="english">
<div class="verse">“With one only reservation,</div>
<div class="verse">I will send you this narration,</div>
<div class="verse">My gentle, natty Valentine,</div>
<div class="verse">Since your love so well content is mine.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Charles d’Anjou died in 1465, greatly lamented by
his poet-confidant.</p>

<p>King René composed and wrote, and also set to
music, very many <i>motets</i> and <i>caroles</i> (dance-songs).
The former are still sung in village churches in
Provence, and the latter danced at village fêtes.</p>

<p>René was famous, too, as a polite letter-writer.
Between 1468 and 1474 he despatched thirty-seven
missives to Pope Sixtus IV. and others, chiefly
relating to affairs in the kingdom of Catalonia.</p>

<p>At the Château d’Angers, as well as at those of
Nancy and Aix, King René had splendid collections
of manuscripts and books. Rare works in Hebrew,
Greek, Arabic, Turkish, and Latin, he collected in the
several departments of Scripture, Philosophy, History,
Geography, Natural History, and Physics. Writers
and students naturally were attracted to such a
sapient Prince. Three of the former in particular
attached themselves to his patronage: Pierre de
Hurion, Jehan de Perin, and Louis de Beauvau; and
with them was René’s chief collaborator&mdash;Hervé
Grellin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<h3>III. <span class="smcap">Craftman’s Works of King René.</span></h3>

<p>René was a great advocate for the combination and
co-operation of the arts and crafts. In no sense was
he a free-trader: his policy was to encourage native
enterprise and to check destructive intrusion of aliens.
To consolidate commercial interests and to safeguard
industries, he established “Orders” or “Guilds” for
workers. For example, at Tarascon he instituted
“The Order of the Sturgeon,” for fisherfolk, which
held an annual festival in July, called <i>La Charibande</i>,
specially in honour of <i>Le Roy des Gardons</i>&mdash;“King
of Roaches.” At Aix the King established “The
Order of the Plough,” for agriculturists, and their
fête-day was the Festival of the Assumption. He
could hold the coulter with any of his farm labourers,
and greatly delighted in matches of strength and
speed. René’s interest in agriculture and stock-rearing
did very much to make Anjou and Provence
fruitful States. He naturalized the sugar-cane, and
introduced many new trees and plants: the rose de
Provence; the <i>Œillet de Poëte</i>&mdash;our Sweet William;
the mulberry; and the Muscat grape.</p>

<p>As patron of crafts, René especially encouraged
workers in tapestry, vestments, costumes and
tournament decorations, goldsmiths, jewellers, medalists,
armourers, and masters of wood, stone, and
metal, with operatives in textiles. In Provence, at
Aix and Marseilles, he had workshops which he himself
superintended, and where such instructors were
employed as Jehan de Nicholas, Guillaume le
Pelletier, Juan d’Arragona, Jehan le Gracieux, Luigi
Rubbotino, Henri Henniquin, and Jehanne De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>spert.
These may be names only, but their fame may be
learnt by the study of useful industries in France.
The <i>Comptes de Roy René</i>,&mdash;René’s business-books,&mdash;at
Angers are full of orders, instructions, payments,
etc., to work-people of all sorts and kinds.</p>

<p>At each of King René’s residences, and more
especially at Aix, he designed and erected a raised
architectural loggia, or terrace, which at once
gained the name of <i>La Cheminée du Roy</i>. Here he was
wont to spend a good deal of his time in the enjoyment
of the fresh air and the contemplation of the
persons and avocations of his subjects within
range. Here, too, he gave audience to all sorts
and conditions of his subjects, passing the time of
the day merely to many, but with some of them
entering fully into matters proposed for his consideration.
Craftsmen, tradesmen, and merchants, were
accustomed to pass that way to expose commodities,
and exhibit novelties which might tempt the Royal
patronage. One salient object of this amiable habit
was that, as he put it, “my children may see their
father, and take cognizance of my state of health and
my pursuits.” René lived and worked among and
for his people, and none who approached him ever
went away empty or dissatisfied. Nothing pleased
him better than a morning salutation or an evening
serenade by troubadour-jongleurs and other makers of
music and of fun. Sometimes the municipal authorities
made courteous protests to their liege Lord for
the creation of crowds and obstruction to the free
circulation of the traffic. To all such representations
the King turned a ready ear, but also turned their
pleas into subjects for good-humoured merriment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“You see,” he used to say, “I am something of a
troubadour myself, and life’s serious moods require
joyous elevation.”</p>

<p>René was great in loving-cups, or, more correctly,
their contents. Nothing pleased him more than to
hand to anyone who had interested or amused him a
delicious beverage, and often enough in the utmost
good-humour he bade the recipient keep the cup as
a memento of his interview&mdash;and “mind,” he added,
“you drink my health and Queen Jehanne’s sometimes.”</p>

<p>René’s consideration of and generosity to his servants
and attendants was proverbial. The <i>Comptes</i> are
full of instructions to his Treasurers to pay such and
such sums of money or other benefactions. To
Jehan de Sérancourt, an equerry, for example, he
gave a purse of 200 ducats, “for thy skilful care of
my favourite charger.” To Alain le Hérault, a valet
and barber “a gold snuffbox and fifty ducats for his
daughter’s confinement.” He was very fond of
quoting the example of Marie d’Harcourt, mother
of his son-in-law Ferri de Vaudémont, who died in
1476. She was affectionately called “the Mother
of the Poor.” “She was rightly
called; am not I, then, father too?”</p>

<p>René was a great collector of works of art and
curios, although, by the way, he was obliged very
frequently to distribute his treasures in order to raise
money for his warlike enterprises and philanthropic
pursuits. A speciality was the acquisition of relics of
saints and other venerable objects. In 1470 he and
Queen Jehanne assisted at the translation of a piece of
the True Cross, which he had obtained in Italy, to
the Church of St. Croix at Angers. Lists of such
treasures, and, indeed, of the treasures in general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> of
his house, may be read in <i>Les Comptes de Roy René</i>.
Many originally came from King John the “Good”
of France, René’s great-grandfather, handed down by
Louis I. and Louis II. of Sicily-Anjou.</p>

<p>René had a penchant for rock-crystal objects and
miniature carvings in wood. Among the former he
possessed a very famous winecup, upon which he
engraved the following quaint conceit:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">YOLANDA D’ARRAGONA&mdash;“A GOOD MOTHER AND A
GREAT QUEEN.”</span></h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The Queen was in labour, and shivering groups of
robust citizens and sturdy peasants were gathered in
front of the royal castle of Zaragoza, eagerly awaiting
the signal of a happy deliverance. The fervent
wish of King Juan for a male heir was shared by his
subjects, for his brother Martino, next in succession,
was in delicate health; moreover, he had only one son,
and he was a cripple. The succession to the throne
was a source of anxiety to all good Aragonese. To
be sure, there was a baby Princess already in the
royal nursery, but whether her mother had been a
lawful wedded wife, or no more than a <i>barragana</i> of
the Sovereign, few knew outside the charmed circle of
the Court. In the opinion of the men and women of
the triple kingdom generally, this mattered little, for
natural children were looked upon as strengthening
the family; <i>hijos de ganancia</i> they were called. The
Salic Law, however, barred the female heirs of the
royal house, so little Juanita was of no importance.</p>

</div>

<p>Within the courtyard, about the royal apartments,
and all through the precincts of the Presence, minstrels
and poets thronged, as well as Ministers and
officials; Queen Yolanda was the Queen of Troubadours,
and the courtiers she loved best to have about
her were merry maids and men&mdash;graduates of the
“<i>Gaya Ciencia</i>.” The livelong night they had danced
and postured, they had piped and sung. Each poet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of the hilarious company had in turn taken up his
recitative, printed by staccato notes, to be repeated
in chorus and in step, until the <i>fandangoes</i> and
<i>boleros</i> of the South were turned into the boisterous
whirling <i>jotas</i> of Aragon. The first dawn of day
brought into play lutes and harps, restrung, retuned
cellos and hurdy-gurdies, and <i>vihuelas de peñola</i>,
guitars with metal wires and struck with strong
herons’ plumes, and so awoke the phlegmatic guardians
of the castle. Sweet and harmonious Provençal
voices blended with soft notes of melodious singers
from Languedoc to the running accompaniment of the
weird Basque music of the mountaineers.</p>

<p>The Queen, upon her massive curtained bed of
state, heard the refrains and felt the vibration of the
lilting measures, and smiled pleasantly as she laid awake
expectantly. At length the great tenor bell up in the
chapel turret gave out the hour of six. The last
note seemed to hang, and many a devout listener
bent a reverent knee and bared his head, whilst the
women-folk uttered fervent <i>Aves</i>. One single stroke
of the metal clapper was followed, alas! immediately by
another. “Two for a Princess!” resounded from
lusty throats, but there was a tone of disappointment
in the cry. The glaring morning sun, however, made
no mistake, impartial in his love of sex. Dancing
upon the phosphorescent ripples of the rolling
Mediterranean, he shot golden beams within the
royal chamber, and crimson flushed the cheeks of the
royal mother and her child. It was the red-hot sun
of Spain, and the day was red, too&mdash;the feast of
San Marco, April 25, 1380.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p>Christened within eight hours of birth&mdash;the custom
in Aragon&mdash;and “Yolanda” named, the little
Princess’s advent was speeded right away to distant
Barrois, her mother’s home, by the Queen’s Chamberlain,
trusty Cavalier Hugues de Pulligny. He had
been summoned at once to the accouchement couch,
and given to hold and identify the babe. With him
he took the Queen’s mothering scarf&mdash;the token of a
happy birth&mdash;and hied post-haste to lay it and his
news at the feet of the anxious Duke and Duchess at
Bar-le-Duc. His reward was a patent of nobility
and 500 good golden livres.</p>

<p>Yolanda, Queen-consort of Juan I., King of the
triple kingdom of Aragon, Catalonia, and Valencia&mdash;Violante
de Bar&mdash;was the elder of the two daughters
of Robert I., Duke of Bar, and his wife, Marie
of France, daughter of King John II., “the
Good.” Their Court was one of the chief resorts
of the Troubadours and Jongleurs, who
looked to the Duke’s famous mother, Princess
Iolande of Flanders, as their queen and patroness.
Bar, or Barrois, first gained royal honours when the
Emperor Otto III., in 958, created his son and
successor, Frederic, Count of Bar and Prince of the
Holy Roman Empire. The succession was handed
down for hundreds of years, and in 1321 Count
Henry IV. married the Flemish Princess. Her
jewels and her trousseau were the talk of half a
century. Her gaiety, her erudition, and her skill in
handicraft, were remarkable; her Court the most
splendid in Europe.</p>

<p>Bar was, so to speak, the golden hub of the great
humming wheel of Franco-Flemish arts and crafts.
Bordered by Luxembourg, Lorraine, Champagne, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Burgundy, the fountain-heads of rich and generous
vintages, she took toll of all, and the Barroisiens
were the healthiest, wealthiest, and the merriest folk
in the French borderland.</p>

<p>The influence of the bewitching and accomplished
Princess-Countess Iolande was paramount, and she
was ever adding to her fame by making royal progresses
throughout her husband’s domains. Wherever
she went, music and the fine arts, and every artistic
cult and useful craft, prospered amazingly. Borne in
a great swaying chariot, drawn by four strong white
Flemish horses, the magnificence of her cortège led
on one occasion, if not on more, nearly to her undoing.
Travelling in the summer-time of the year 1361 to
Clermont en Argonne, one of the ducal castles, she
was, when not very far away from storied Laon, beset
by an armed company of outlaws, who, however,
treated her with charming courtesy. They caused
the Princess and her ladies to descend from their
equipage and step it with them as <i>vis-à-vis</i> under the
greenwood tree. Then, not very gallantly, to be
sure, they stripped their fair partners of their ornaments
and despoiled the princely treasure, causing the
Princess to sign a pardon for their onslaught. The
adventure, however, did not end here, for Iolande
was a match for any man, and on the spot she
enrolled her highwaymen as recruits for Count
Henry’s army!</p>

<p>The almost fairy Princess-Countess survived her
consort many years, and lived to see the county of
Bar raised to a dukedom, and to dance upon her
knee a little namesake granddaughter, Violante de
Bar. Nothing gave her greater pleasure than the
floral games of the troubadours, and one of these
<i>fêtes galants</i> was enacted in 1363 at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> Ducal
Castle of Val de Cassel, where Duchess Marie had
just brought into the world this very baby girl. The
poets chose their laureate&mdash;one Eustache Deschamps-Morel,
and Princess Iolande crowned him
with bays. The <i>ballade</i> he composed for those auspicious
revels is still extant&mdash;<i>Du Métier Profitable</i>&mdash;wherein
he maintains that only two careers are
open to happy mortals.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Ces deux ont partout l’avantage,</div>
<div class="verse">L’un en junglant, l’autre à corner.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The sights and sounds, then, which first greeted the
pretty child were merry and tuneful. She was reared
on troubadour fare, on troubadour lore. Violante
had three brothers, Édouard, Jehan, and Louis, and a
younger sister Bonne, married to Nicholas, Comte
de Ligny, but alas! buried with her first-born before
the high-altar of St. Étienne at Bar-le-Duc.</p>

<p>When Violante was in her seventeenth year, there
came a royal traveller, disguised as a troubadour of
Languedoc, to the Court of Love at Bar-le-Duc.
His quest was for a bride. He was of ancient
lineage; his forbears came from Ria, in a southern
upland valley of the Eastern Pyrenees, and had ruled
the land ’twixt barren mountain and wild seacoast
for no end of years&mdash;Juan I., King of Aragon,
Catalonia, and Valencia. He had just buried
Mahaud d’Armagnac, the young mother of his little
daughter Juanita, and there was a gaping wound
in his amorous heart which yearned for healing.
The royal Benedict looked for a Venus with a dash
of Diana and a measure of Minerva, and chroniclers
say he had drawn blank the Courts of Spain and
Southern France. Moreover, they tell a pretty tal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>e
of him which must now again be told.</p>

<p>After wanderings manifold, the royal knight-errant
found himself within the pageant-ground of Bar-le-Duc
and at a “Court of Love.” There he broke shield
and lance at tilt, and Prince Cupid pierced his heart.
Mingling in the merry throng, King Juan found himself
partnered by the most beauteous damsel his eyes
had ever seen. She was the Princess Violante,
daughter of the Duke. Before she realized what her
gay <i>vis-à-vis</i> had said and done, he vanished. But upon
her maiden finger glittered a royal signet-ring. Back
to Zaragoza sped the gay troubadour, and in a trice
a noble embassy was on its way to the Barrois Court
to claim the hand of the fascinating Princess and to
exchange the heavy ring of State for the lighter
jewelled hoop of espousal.</p>

<p>The entry of Queen Yolanda (Violante) into
Zaragoza was a resplendent function, and, despite
their habitual taciturnity, the citizens hailed the
lovely consort of their King with heartiest acclamations.
In her train came minstrels and glee-maidens
from Champagne and Burgundy, from Provence and
the Valley of the Rhine and Languedoc. Such
merry folk were unknown in phlegmatic Aragon.
To be sure, they had their poets, their dances and
their songs, but they were the semi-serious pastimes
of the sturdy Basque mountaineers.</p>

<p>The <i>Académie des Jeux Floraux</i> of Toulouse,&mdash;newly
founded in 1323, and better known there as
the <i>Collège du Gaye Sçavoir</i>,&mdash;sent an imposing
company of minstrels to greet the new Queen of
Aragon at Narbonne&mdash;the city of romance and song&mdash;and
to offer her a spectacular serenade beneath
the balconies of the Archiepiscopal Palace, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
she and her suite were accommodated. With them
they bore golden flowers and silver with which
Royal Violante should crown the laureates, and to
Her Majesty they offered a great amaranth of
gold, together with the diploma of a <i>Mainteneuse</i>.
Acclaimed “Queen of Troubadours,” her motley
train swept through the cities of the coast and
crossed the Spanish frontier. One and all offered
her their true allegiance&mdash;to live and dance and sing
and die for Yolanda d’Arragona.</p>

<p>If the Aragonese were noted for stubbornness,&mdash;and
of them was curtly said: “The men of Aragon
will drive nails in their heads rather than use
hammers,”&mdash;they have a sound reputation for chivalry.
King Iago II. established this characteristic in an
edict in 1327. “We will,” ran the royal rescript,
“that every man, whether armed or not, who shall
be in company with a lady, pass safely and unmolested
unless he be guilty of murder.” Courting an <i>alegra
señorita</i>, whether of Aragon, Catalonia, or Valencia,
was the duty of every lad, albeit the fair one jokingly
called it “<i>pelando la pava</i>” (plucking the turkey).
The royal romance was a charming example for all
and sundry, and many an amorous French troubadour
had his wings cut by Prince Cupid and never went
home again at all, and many a glee-maiden, to boot,
plucked a “turkey” of Aragon!</p>

<p>King Juan threw himself unreservedly into the
arms of his merry Minerva-Venus Queen: no doubt
she “plucked” him thoroughly! A “Court of Love”
was established at Zaragoza. All day long they
danced, and all night through they sang, and at all times
played their floral games, whilst dour señors scowled
and proud dueñas grimaced. The revels of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>“<i>Gaya
Ciencia</i>” shocked their susceptibilities, until a crisis
was reached in 1340, when the King sent embassies
to all the French Courts to enlist the services of their
best troubadours. A solemn session of the Cortes,
wherein resided the actual power of the State,&mdash;the
King was King only by their pleasure,&mdash;was called,
“<i>Podemos mas que vos</i>”&mdash;“We are quite as good as
you, or even better”&mdash;that was the moving spirit of
Aragon. A resolution was passed demanding the
suppression of “the feast of folly,” as the gay doings
at Court were called, and the immediate expulsion of
the foreign minstrels and their hilarious company.</p>

<p>Here was a fix for the easy-going King,&mdash;dubbed
by many “<i>l’Indolente</i>,” the Indolent,&mdash;between the
devil and the deep sea. The Queen point-blank
refused to say good-bye to her <i>devotés</i>, and her
wiles prevailed to retain many a merry lover at her
Court, for the stoutest will of man yields to the
witchery of beauty in every rank of life!</p>

<p>If Queen Yolanda was a “gay woman,” as historians
have called her,&mdash;and no class of men are
anything like so mendacious,&mdash;she was not the “fast”
woman some of them have maliciously styled her.
No, she was a loving spouse and a devoted mother.
Perhaps, could she have chosen, she would have
brought forth a boy; but, still, every mother loves her
child regardless of sex or other considerations. She
addressed herself zealously to the rearing of the little
princess. No sour-visaged <i>hidalgo</i> and no censorious
citizen was allowed the entrée to the nursery.
Minstrels rejoiced at the nativity, and minstrels
shared the rocking of the cradle. She was baptized
at the old mosque-like cathedral of Sa Zeo, or San
Salvador,&mdash;where the Kings her forbears were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
anointed and crowned,&mdash;with the courtly ceremonial
of Holy Church, whilst outside the people sang their
well-loved ditties. Quite the favourite was “<i>Nocte
Buena</i>”&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">and many, many other verses. Zaragoza was famous
for the splendour of her mystery plays, as many
quaint entries in the archives of the archdiocese
prove: “Seven <i>sueldos</i> for making up the heads of
the ass and the ox for the stable at Bethlehem; six
<i>sueldos</i> for wigs for the prophets; ten <i>sueldos</i> for
gloves for the angels.”</p>

<p>The little Princess was not the only occupant of
the royal nursery in Zaragoza; King Juan’s child
Juanita greeted her baby companion with glee, but
the Queen was not too well pleased that she should
be allowed to remain there. Indeed, an arrangement
was come to whereby Mahaud’s child was delivered
over to a <i>governante</i>, and Princess Yolanda was
queen of all she saw. Very carefully her training
was taken in hand, with due respect to the peccadilloes
of the Court; but her mother saw to it that her
environment should be youthful, bright, and intelligent.
Hardly before the child was out of leading-strings her
future was under serious consideration, for the King
had no son nor the promise of one by his consort, and
Queen Yolanda determined to do all that lay in her
power to circumvent the obnoxious clauses of th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>e
Salic Law.</p>

<p>The Princess grew up handsome like her father and
bewitching like her mother. She was the pet of the
palace and the pride of the people, and everybody
prophesied great things for her and Aragon. The
most important question was, naturally, betrothal and
marriage. The King, easy-going in everything, left
this delicate matter to his ambitious, clever Queen,
and very soon half the crowns <i>in posse</i> in Europe were
laid at her daughter’s feet.</p>

<p>The survey of eligible lads of royal birth was far
and wide, but, with the tactful instinct of a ruling
native, Queen Yolanda made a very happy choice.
At Toulouse, three years before the birth of her little
daughter, had been born a royal Prince, the eldest
son of her uncle Louis of France, her mother’s
brother, titular King of Naples, Sicily, and Jerusalem,
Duke of Anjou, and Count of Provence. The boy’s
mother was Countess Marie de Châtillon, the wealthy
heiress of the ducal line of Blois-Bretagne. He was
the husband-to-be of Princess Yolanda d’Arragona,
Louis d’Anjou. King Juan cordially approved the
selection of the young Prince: French royal marriages
were popular in Aragon. An imposing
embassy was despatched at once to Angers, with an
invitation for the boy to visit the Court of Zaragoza
under the charge of his aunt, Queen Yolanda. The
King and Queen made the most they could of their
interesting little visitor. With a view to contingencies,
Louis was introduced at the session of the Cortes,
and the King gave splendid entertainments to the
<i>ricoshombres</i> and other members of the Estates in
honour of his future son-in-law, the royal fiancé of
the <i>soi-disante</i> heiress to the throne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>This notable visit came to an abrupt and unexpected
end upon receipt of the news of the sudden death of
King-Duke Louis at the Castle of Bisclin, in La
Pouille, on September 20, 1389. His young son,
now Louis II., was called home at once. Met at the
Languedoc frontier by a kingly escort, the young
Sovereign passed on to Arles, and thence to Avignon,
where, on October 25, 1389, he was solemnly crowned
in the basilica of Nôtre Dame des Dons by Pope
Clement VII. A stately progress was made to the
Court of Charles VI. in Paris, and the youthful King
was presented to imperious Queen Isabeau,&mdash;his
aunt by marriage,&mdash;the proud daughter of Stephen II.,
Duke of Bavaria, and Princess Thadée Visconti of
Milan.</p>

<p>The chief object of this visit was the formal
betrothal of the young King and the Princess
Yolanda d’Arragona&mdash;a ceremony deemed too important
for celebration either at Angers or at Aix, in
the King’s domains. A notable function, in the
grand metropolitan cathedral of Nôtre Dame, was
held on, of all days the most suitable, the Feast of
the Three Holy Kings, January 6, 1390, whereat
assisted all the Princes and Princesses of the House
of France, with Prince Ferdinand of Castile and
Aragon as proxy for the bride-Princess, and an
imposing embassy from King Juan and Queen
Yolanda.</p>

<p>Back to Angers went, with his mother, Queen-Duchess
Marie, the youthful bridegroom-elect, to be
safeguarded and trained for his brilliant career.
Everybody in Anjou and Provence loved their
Duchess. She had won al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>l hearts. Those were
prosperous, happy days&mdash;the days of the gracious
Regent’s kindly government.</p>

<p>Early in 1393 King Juan met with a serious
accident whilst hunting in the mountains around
Tacca, the ancient capital of Aragon. He was, by
the way, a famous huntsman, and had gained by his
keenness in pursuit of game the title of “<i>El Cazador</i>”&mdash;“The
Sportsman.” Mauled by a wolf he had
wounded in the chase, he never recovered from the
loss of blood and the poison of those unclean fangs.
Feeling his end approaching, and anxious about the
future of his darling child, he proposed to Queen
Marie and the Anjou-Provence Court of Regency
that the nuptials of Louis and Yolanda should be
celebrated without delay. This he did because he
had determined to evade the restrictions of the Salic
Law by proclaiming Louis and Yolanda heir and
heiress together of Aragon, Catalonia, and Valencia.</p>

<p>Queen Yolanda most heartily seconded her consort’s
project,&mdash;indeed, she it was who had first
suggested that line of action,&mdash;and when, on
May 15, the King breathed his last in the castle
of his fathers in Zaragoza, she claimed the succession
for her son-in-law and daughter. On the day following
the King’s death she took the young Princess,&mdash;barely
thirteen years of age,&mdash;accompanied by the
whole Court and a crowd of sympathetic citizens,
into the basilica of Sa Zeo, and placed her upon the
magnificent and historic silver throne of the Kings
of Aragon. Bending her knees before her, she
kissed the child’s hand in homage to her sovereignty,
and caused heralds to proclaim her “<i>Yolanda Reina
d’Arragona</i>.” It was a bold step, but quite in accord
with the ruling instinct of the royal house; moreover,
it commanded the suffrages of very many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
members of the Cortes.</p>

<p>The Estates of the three realms met in plenary
session, and before the deliberations were opened the
little “Queen” was presented by her mother, who
demanded a unanimous vote in favour of Louis and
Yolanda. There were, however, other claimants for
the crown, and the Cortes decided to offer it to Dom
Martino, the late King’s only surviving brother, a
next heir-male of the blood, whose consort was Queen
Maria of Sicily. The new King treated his widowed
sister-in-law and his little niece with the utmost consideration.
He prevailed upon Queen Yolanda to
retain the royal apartments at the castle, for he did
not propose to reside there. He only stayed at
Zaragoza for his coronation, and returned at once to
Palermo.</p>

<p>The whole energy of the widowed Queen was now
devoted to the education of her only child. Her
widowhood weighed lightly upon her; her buoyant,
happy nature soon shook off her grief and mourning.
She was now perfectly free to cultivate her tastes. If
the “little Queen” was not to be Queen of Aragon,
she should succeed herself as “Queen of Hearts and
Troubadours.” Accordingly she moved her residence
to Barcelona, the sunny and the gay, and there at
once set up a “Court of Love.” Catalonia was times
out of mind the rival of Provence in romance and
minstrelsy; her marts had quite as many merry
troubadours as serious merchants. The <i>corridas de
toros</i>&mdash;bullfights&mdash;of Barcelona were the most
brilliant in Spain, whilst the people were as independent
and as unconventional as they were
cultured and industrious. The two Queens very
soon became expert <i>aficionadas</i> of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>royal sport.</p>

<p>Queen Yolanda never for a moment lost sight of
the future of her daughter, and preparations for her
marriage to Louis d’Anjou occupied very much of
her busy, merry, useful life. Queens’ trousseaux
were something more than nine days’ wonders; besides,
the ambition of the mother-Queen knew no
bounds to her daughter’s horizon. She must go
forth at least as richly clothed and dowered as
any of her predecessors. Goldsmiths, glass-blowers,
cabinet-makers, saddlers, silk-weavers, and potters,&mdash;none
more accomplished and famous in Europe than
the artificers of Barcelona and Valencia,&mdash;were set to
work to fill the immense walnut marriage-chests of
the bride-to-be. Her jewels were superb,&mdash;no richer
gold was known than the red gold of Aragon,&mdash;the
royal gems were unique, of Moorish origin, uncut.
Years passed quickly along, and Princess Yolanda
kept her eighteenth birthday with her mother in
Barcelona. She was on the threshold of a new life.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>One glorious autumn morning in the good year
1399,&mdash;“good” because “the next before a brand-new
century,” as said the gossips of the time,&mdash;a gallant
cavalcade deployed down the battlemented approach
to the grim old castle of Angers. At its head,
mounted upon a prancing white Anjou charger, rode
as comely a young knight as ever hoisted pennoned
lance to stirrup-lock. He was dressed in semi-armour,&mdash;the
armour of the “Lists.” His errand was
not warlike, for knotted in his harness were Cupid’s
love-ribbons: he was a royal bridegroom-elect speeding
off to bring gaily home from distant Aragon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
fair betrothed. He had been knighted ten years
before by his uncle, Charles VI., at his coronation in
Nôtre Dame in Paris, at which solemnity he had,&mdash;a
slim lad of twelve,&mdash;held proudly the stirrup of the
Sovereign.</p>

<p>Louis II. d’Anjou, born at the Castle of Toulouse
on October 7, 1377, succeeded his father, Louis I., in
1389, and, like him, bore many titles of sovereignty:
King of Naples, Sicily, and Jerusalem; Duke of
Anjou, Calabria, Touraine, and Pouille; Grand Peer
of France; Prince of Capua; Count of Provence,
Maine, Forcalquier, and Piemont; Lord of Montpellier;
and Governor of Languedoc and Guienne.
His grandfather was the brave but unfortunate King
John “the Good” of France; his grandmother, the
beautiful but sorrowful Queen Bonne of Luxembourg
and Bohemia.</p>

<p>The boy-King carrouselled through the lumbering
gates of Angers that brilliant October morning
between two trusty knights of his household,&mdash;loyal
lieges of their late King now devoted to the service
of the son. As valiant in deeds of war as discreet in
affairs of State were Raymond d’Agout and Jehan de
Morien. All three bore the proud cognizance of
Sicily-Anjou,&mdash;the golden flying eagle,&mdash;and their
silken bannerets were sewn with the white lilies of
the royal house of France. A goodly retinue of
mounted men followed the young King, guarding the
person and the costly bridal gifts which accompanied
the royal lover’s cortège.</p>

<p>Queen-Duchess Marie, his mother, had kept as
Regent unweariedly her long ten years’ watch, not
only over the business of the State, but also ove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>r the
passions and the actions of her lusty, well-grown son.
Many a maid,&mdash;royal, noble, and simple,&mdash;had
attracted the comely youth’s regard, and had flushed
her face and his. Women and girls of his time were,
as an appreciative chronicler has noted, “<i>franches,
désintéressés, capable d’amours, épidémentés, elles
restent naïve très longtemps, parceque les vices
étrangères n’ont point pénetrés dans les familles</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
Louis had responded affectionately and loyally to
his mother’s solicitude; he was famed as the
St. Sebastian of his time, whose chastity and good
report had no sharp shaft of scandal pierced.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> “Natural, open-hearted, amorous, and accessible, they are
always unspoiled because odious foreign manners have never marred
their home.”</p>

</div>

<p>The royal cavalcade pranced its way warily over
the wide-rolling plains and across the gently cresting
hill-country of Central France, making for the Spanish
frontier. The whole of that smiling land was ravaged
by foreign foes and overrun by native ne’er-do-wells,
but, happily, no thrilling adventures have been
recorded of that lengthy progress. Near upon the
eve of St. Luke, King Louis II. and his suite were
cordially welcomed in his royal castle of Montpellier,
which the two mother-Queens, Marie and Yolanda,
had indicated as the trysting-place. There the royal
Court was established, whilst d’Agout and de
Morien were despatched, with a lordly following, to
Perpignan and across the frontier of Aragon to greet,
at the Castle of Gerona, the two Yolandas&mdash;who were
already on their way from Barcelona&mdash;and thence
escort them to their Sovereign’s presence.</p>

<p>The young “Queen” was quite as anxious to
meet her affianced husband as he was to embrace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
her, and no undue delay hindered the resumption of
the queenly progress. It was a notable cortège, for
Queen Yolanda, holding as she did tenaciously that
her daughter was, at least, titular Queen of Aragon,
Catalonia, and Valencia, travelled in extravagant
royal state. Besides the great chariot, with its
tapestries and furniture of richest Hispano-Moorish
origin, were others almost as sumptuous for the lords
and ladies of the suite. All these had their guards
of honour&mdash;trusty veterans of King Juan’s time, and
devoted to their “Queen.” Great tumbrils, laden
with costly products of Zaragoza, Barcelona, and
Valencia,&mdash;the royal trousseau and magnificent offerings
for King Louis and his widowed mother,&mdash;accompanied
by well-mounted cavalry, rolled heavily
along the ancient Roman road to France.</p>

<p>The whole of Languedoc agreed to pay honour to
the royal travellers, and they revelled in the floral
games and <i>fêtes galants</i> offered by every town and
castle by the way. From Toulouse, the birthplace of
the bridegroom-elect, came quite appropriately a
phalanx of <i>maintaineurs</i> to Montpellier to recite and
sing poems and melodies of the “<i>Gaya Ciencia</i>.” The
green rolling hills of Languedoc gave back in sweetly
echoing refrains the tuneful music of the shell-sown
shores of the rolling sea, the sun-kissed Mediterranean:
all sang the “Loves of Louis and Yolanda.”</p>

<p>There is a quaint and suggestive story anent the
meeting of the august young couple which calls to
mind the adventures of King Juan at the Court of
Bar-le-Duc. The young King had timely warning
of the approach of his royal bride-elect, and, hastily
donning the guise of a simple knight, he mingled in
the throng of enthusiastic citizens, unrecognized, at
the entrance of the town. Both Queens leaned forw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>ard
in their chariot to acknowledge the loyal greetings;
and the bride,&mdash;arrayed in golden tissue of
Zaragoza, and wearing Anjou lilies in her hair,&mdash;smiled
and laughed and clapped her hands in ecstasy,
the animation adding immensely to her charms of
face and figure. King Louis was enraptured, and,
falling head over ears in love, approached the royal
carriage; and kneeling on his <i>berretta</i>, he seized the
youthful Queen’s white, shapely hand, and implanted
thereupon one ardent kiss. The impact sent the hot
blood coursing through his veins, and it was as much
as his esquire could do to drag his master back and
hurry him to the palace in time to change his
costume and receive his royal guests with courtly
etiquette. The young Queen was conscious of this
outburst of love; she, too, coloured, and tried in vain
to penetrate the disguise of her impassioned lover.
The mother-Queen instinctively guessed who he was,
and quietly remarked: “You will meet your gallant
knight again, and soon&mdash;and no mistake.”</p>

<p>Montpellier was all too small to accommodate such
a numerous and such a distinguished company, so
King Louis gave his royal visitors barely time to
recover from the fatigues of the long coach-ride out
of Spain when he hurried on the royal train to Arles,
in Provence. Queen-Duchess Marie was already
waiting at the great Archiepiscopal Palace to give the
royal visitors a cordial greeting. After having waved
her son adieu from the boudoir-balcony of the Castle
of Angers, she, too, set out for the south. She had
chosen Arles for the royal nuptials, as being the
capital of the third great kingdom of Europe and the
most considerable city in her son’s dominions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<p>No better choice could have been made from a
psychological point of view, for have not the Arlésiennes
been noted for all time for their perfect figures,&mdash;Venus
di Milo was one of them,&mdash;their graceful
carriage, and surpassingly good looks? They, with
their menfolk, animated and merry, have always eaten
well and well drunk. The delicious pink St. Peray
is a more generous wine than all the vintages of
Champagne. Physical charms and <i>fin bouquets</i> were
ever incentives to love and pleasure, and Mars of
Aragon yielded up his arms to Venus of Arles.
<i>Arles&mdash;la belle Grecque aux yeux Sarrazines!</i>
Perhaps the becoming, close-fitting black velvet
<i>chapelles</i>, or bonnets, and the diaphanous white
gauze veils, did much to express <i>la grâce fière aux
femmes</i>!</p>

<p>It was indeed a gorgeous function at which the
royal couple were united in the bonds of matrimony,
that morrow of All Saints, 1399. The ancient
basilica of St. Trophimus was one vast nave, no
choir,&mdash;that the royal brothers Louis and René built
a generation later,&mdash;but it was too circumscribed for
the marriage ritual; consequently, under a gold and
crimson awning, slung on ships’ masts beyond the
deeply recessed chief portal, with its weird sculptures,
the clergy took up their station to await the bridal
pageant. The Cardinal-Archbishop, Nicholas de
Brancas, joined the two young hands in wedlock, and
Cardinal Adreano Savernelli, the Papal Legate, gave
the blessing of Peter, whilst the two mother-Queens
looked on approvingly.</p>

<p>The royal bride,&mdash;in white, of course,&mdash;had an over-kirtle,
or train, of gemmed silver tissue&mdash;a thing of
wonderment and beauty worn by her royal mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and her mother, Marie de France, before her, and
coming from the Greco-Flemish trousseau of the
famous Countess Iolande. Her abundant brown-black
hair was plaited in two thick ropes, with pearls
and silver lace reaching far below the jewelled golden
cincture that encompassed her well-formed bust.
Upon her thinly covered bosom reposed the kingly
medallion of her father, King Juan, with its massive
golden chain of Estate, the emblem of her sovereign
rank. Upon her finger she wore the simple ruby ring
of betrothal, now to be exchanged for the plain
golden hoop of marriage.</p>

<p>“Yolande is one of the most lovely creatures anybody
could imagine.” So wrote grim old Juvenal
des Ursins, the chatty chronicler of Courts. She
brought to her royal spouse a rich dowry&mdash;much of
the private wealth of her father and many art
treasures, among them great lustred dishes and vases
of Hispano-Moorish potters’ work, with the royal
arms and cipher thereon. Four baronies, too, passed
to the Sicily-Anjou crown: Lunel in Languedoc&mdash;famed
for vintages of sweet muscatel wines&mdash;Berre,
Martignes, and Istres, all bordering the salt Étang
de Berre, in Provence, each a Venice in miniature,
and rich in salt, salt-dues, and works. The royal
bride’s splendid marriage-chests were packed full of
costly products of King Juan’s kingdoms: table
services in gold from Zaragoza and finely-cut gems;
delicate glass <i>arruxiados</i>, or scent-sprinklers, and
crystal tazzas from Barcelona&mdash;more famous than
Murano; great brazen vessels from Valencia and
richly-woven textiles.</p>

<p>The same veracious historian has painted a picture
in words of the youthful Yolande. “Tall,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
“slim, erect, well proportioned in her frame, her
features of a Spanish cast, dark lustrous hair, the
Queen-Duchess has an intrepid heart and an elevated
spirit, which give animation and distinction to her
charming personality. She is remarkable for decision,
and commands obedience by her authoritative
manner.”</p>

<p>The Court did not tarry long at Arles, for, in
spite of the beauty of the women and the gallantry
of the men and its other notable attractions, it was,
after all, somewhat of a dull, unhealthy place. A
move was accordingly made,&mdash;before, indeed, the
festivities were quite exhausted,&mdash;to the comfortable
and roomy <i>manoir</i> of Tarascon, a very favourite
country residence of all the Provence Princes. The
gardens were famous, and laid out in the Italian
manner, and the extensive park and fresh-water lakes
were well stocked with game and fish. The <i>fêtes
galants</i> of Louis XV. and “La Pompadour” here
had their model. The bridal couple, with their
guests and retainers,&mdash;often as not in the guise of
shepherds and shepherdesses,&mdash;thus kept there state
for three merry months, until the warmer spring
weather hurried them off to Angers, in the north.</p>

</div>

<p>The pretty legend of St. Martha of Bethany
appealed to the young Queen-Duchess. In the
crypt of the principal church of Tarascon is the tomb
of the saint, and on the walls is her story sculptured.
Once upon a time a deadly dragon,&mdash;called by the
fearful country-folk “Tarasque,”&mdash;dwelt in a hollow
cave by the Rhone shore, and fed on human flesh.
News of the devastation wrought by the monster
reached the ears of Lazarus and his sisters at Marseilles,
and St. Martha took upon herself to subdue
the beast. With nothing in her hand but a piece <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>of
the true Cross of Christ and her silken girdle of many
ells in length, she sought out the deadly dragon in
his lair. Casting around his loathsome body her
light cincture, she enabled her companions to slay
him. The girdle of St. Martha became the mascot
of all the Tarasconnais, and everybody wore a goodly
belt or bodice <i>à la Marthe</i>. Such a girdle, in cloth
of gold and tasselled, was offered to the young bride
by the loyal townsfolk.</p>

<p>The state entry of the Sovereigns into Angers,&mdash;the
major capital of the King-Duke’s dominions,&mdash;was
just such another pageant as that which greeted
Queen Isabeau of Bavaria in Paris in the summer of
1385. From ancient days Angers had been a place
of note&mdash;the Andegavi of Gallo-Roman times, a
<i>municipium</i> and a <i>castrum</i> combined. In the
Carlovingian era the Counts&mdash;then Dukes&mdash;of the
Angevines,&mdash;founders of the great Capet family,&mdash;and
their vigorous consorts nursed stalwart sons, who
were the superiors of their neighbour rulers in Frankland.
From Geoffrey Plantagenet, titular King of
Jerusalem, sprang our English Kings. Louis IX.,&mdash;St.
Louis of blessed memory,&mdash;bestowed the duchy of
Anjou upon his brother John with the title of King
of the Two Sicilies; hence came the sovereign titles
of Louis II. and Yolande.</p>

<p>The Castle of Angers in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries was one of the most imposing in
France. Flanked by eighteen great donjon towers,
shaped like dice-boxes, it had the aspect of a prison
rather than of a palace. The royal apartments were
between two great bastions, <i>Le Tour du Moulin</i> and
<i>Le Tour du Diable</i>. The drawbridge spanned the
deep, wide moat to the esplanade called <i>Le Pont <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>du
Monde</i>; beneath were dark dungeons and odious
oubliettes. To honour their King and Queen, the
castle household hung great swaying lengths of scarlet
“noble cloth,”&mdash;newly purchased from the Florentine
merchants of the “<i>Calimala</i>,”&mdash;to cover up the black
slate-stone courses of the masonry of <i>Le Diable</i>, whilst
they concealed the rough masonry of <i>Le Moulin</i> by
strips of gorgeous yellow canvas of Cholet d’Anjou.
These were the heraldic colours of Aragon. All the
gloomy slate-fronted houses of the city,&mdash;“Black
Angers” it was called,&mdash;were decorated similarly,
and gay Flemish carpets and showy skins of beasts
were flaunted from the windows. The citizens kept
holiday with bunches of greenery and early spring
flowers in their hands to cast at their new liege Lady.</p>

<p>Queen Yolande waved her gloved hand,&mdash;a novelty
in demure Angers,&mdash;in friendly response to the
plaudits of the throngs, and refused no kiss of
bearded mouth or cherry lips thereon as she rode
on happily by the side of her royal spouse. At
St. Maurice,&mdash;the noble cathedral, with its new and
glorious coloured windows,&mdash;the royal cortège halted
whilst <i>Te Deum</i> was sung, and the bridal pair were
sprinkled with holy water and censed. Another
“Station” was made where the ascent to the castle
began, for there pious loyal folk had prepared the
mystery-spectacles of the “Resurrection of Christ”
with “His Appearance to His Virgin Mother.” The
Saviour’s features, by a typical but strange conceit,
were those of the King-Duke, St. Mary’s those of
the royal bride!</p>

<p>The banquetings and junketings were scenes of
deep amazement to the new Queen. In Aragon and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Barcelona people ate and drank delicately,&mdash;their
menus were <i>à la Grecque</i>,&mdash;but in cold and phlegmatic
Anjou great hunks of beef and great mugs of
sack,&mdash;quite <i>à la Romain</i>,&mdash;were <i>de rigueur</i>. An
old kitchen reporter of Angers records the daily fare
at the castle: “One whole ox, two calves, three sheep,
three pigs, twelve fowls.” The only artistic confection
was “hippocras, seasoned with cloves and cinnamon.”
Pepper, ginger, rosemary, mint, and thyme,
were served as “delicacies.” Another harsh note on
the fitness of things which struck the royal bride as
extraordinary was the loud laughter indulged in by
the gentlemen of the Court and their coarse jests; <i>le
rire français</i> had nothing of the mellowed merriment
of the “<i>Gaya Ciencia</i>.”</p>

<p>Alas! the rejoicings and the feastings of the
Angevines and their guests were suddenly arrested,
and the enthusiastic shouts of welcome were drowned
by harsh hammerings of armourers and raucous military
commands. The King-Duke was summoned to
take his position among the captains of France, in
battle order, in face of the foreign foe, and the Queen-Duchess,
young and inexperienced as she was, assumed
the government of Angers and the care of the citizens.
All France was ravaged by the English, and State
after State fell before their onslaught. Yolande
addressed herself to the strengthening of the defences
of the castle and the city. Imitating the tact and
prudence of Silvestro and Giovanni de’ Medici at
Florence, she ordered the levying of a poll-tax, rated
upon the variations of land-tenure and the varying
incomes of the craftsmen: a tenth of all rateable
property,&mdash;shrewdly spread over three years, with a
credit for immediate needs,&mdash;was cordially yielded by
the Angevines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Probably this impost was made upon the advice of
worthy councillors, but, all the same, the manner in
which the young <i>châtelaine</i> Lieutenant-General in
person superintended its operation was an eloquent
testimony to her force of character and her true
patriotism. She disposed of many personal belongings,
and submitted to many acts of self-denial, an
example quickly followed by great and small. She
sent also to Zaragoza for master-armourers to refurbish
old and temper new weapons of various sorts. Some
of these craftsmen she ordered to give instruction to
native workers; so very shortly her armoury was
efficient, not alone for home defence, but for the rearming
of the King’s forces in the field.</p>

<p>Not content with these warlike preparations,
Queen Yolande gave time and money for the distraction
and amusement of her people in their time of
stress. Castle fêtes, town sports, and church
mystery plays, were bravely carried through. The
Queen herself was everywhere&mdash;now mounted for
the chase, now tending sick folks, now at public
prayers. Born daughter of a grand race, and full of
dignity, she had inherited her mother’s happy disposition.
She charmed everyone in town and country,
and endeared herself to her loving subjects by many a
homely trait.</p>

<p>A pretty tale has been preserved about her whilst
King Louis was standing shoulder to shoulder with
Charles VI. and his other peers of France. One
afternoon,&mdash;according to her wont when not hindered
by affairs of State or claims of charity,&mdash;she sallied
forth to the royal park of L’Vien, her dogs in leash.
Let loose, they put up a rabbit, which made directly
for their royal mistress, and sought refuge in th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>e skirt
of her green velvet hunting-kirtle. Reaching down
her hand, she fondled the little trembling creature,
when, to her immense surprise, she discovered upon
its neck a faded ribbon, with a medallion bearing an
image of the Virgin. The incident occurred in a
woody dell within the ruins of a half-buried hermit’s
cell. Yolande did not for a moment hesitate in her
interpretation of the incident. She noted the date,&mdash;February
2, the Feast of the Purification,&mdash;and
she set to work to restore the holy house in honour
of St. Mary. Upon the portal, by her command,
was sculptured the charming episode, with the
legend: “<i>Nôtre Dame de Sousterre, l’amie et la
protectrice des âmes en danger.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_2" id="Footnote_A_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_2"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> “Our Lady of the Deep Cell, the friend and protectress of souls
in danger.”</p>

</div>

<p>The same year, 1401, found Louis d’Anjou and
Yolande upon their way to Paris, where she, as
Queen of Jerusalem, Naples, Sicily, and Aragon,
made her state entry at the Court of Charles VI.
and Isabeau. Doubtless the young Queen was struck
with Isabeau’s extraordinary freedom of manner.
Her own training, both at Zaragoza and Barcelona,
in the rigid conventions of a semi-Moorish Court, had
taught her restraint and aloofness. The dress of the
French Queen astonished her, for in Aragon and
Catalonia physical charms were enhanced by semi-concealment,
whereas Isabeau exposed her painted
arms, shoulders, and her breast, right down to her
cincture; whilst her low waist at the back was
pinched by a <i>cotte hardie</i>, so that the bust was
enlarged to the degree of distortion: <i>une taille de
guêpe</i>&mdash;“wasp-like” indeed! The etiquette of the
Court of her father, as well as tha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>t of Anjou, kept
men out of the bedchambers of the fair, but Isabeau,
<i>décolletée</i> and <i>en déshabillée</i>, was the centre of a crowd
of flatterers and fawners at her daily <i>se lever</i>. The
dressing-room of Isabeau was the factory of gossip
and intrigue. Perhaps she gave utterance to the
aphorism:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Ostez le fard et le vice,</div>
<div class="verse">Vous luy ostez l’âme et le corps.”</div>
<div class="english">
<div class="verse">“Take away fashion and vice,</div>
<div class="verse">And you expose both soul and body.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On her side Queen Yolande caused a sensation
among the French courtiers. No one had ever seen
such a wealth of gold and jewels as that which
adorned the winsome Spanish Queen. In spite of
their great dissimilarity in age, appearance, character,
and manner, the two Queens became fast friends, and
Yolande was permitted to weld the intimacy into a
permanent relationship at the fortunate accouchement
of Isabeau. With admirable simplicity and charm
she assumed the charge of the royal infant, sponsored
it, and gave it her own name added to Catherine.
Born to be the consort of Henry V. of England, the
victor of Azincourt, Catherine de Valois served as the
gracious hostage and pledge of a greatly-longed-for
peace.</p>

<p>Queen Yolande was, however, approaching her own
accouchement, and Louis, judging that a fortified
castle was not a desirable locality for such an
auspicious event, hurried his consort and her boudoir
entourage off to Toulouse, the gay capital of Languedoc&mdash;Toulouse
of the Troubadours. There, upon
September 25, 1403, within the palace, Yolande
brought forth her first-born, her royal husband’s son
and heir. Louis the bonny boy was named by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Archbishop at the font of St. Étienne’s Cathedral.
Great was the joy over all the harvest-fields and
vineyards of Provence and Languedoc. Perhaps the
good folk of Aix felt themselves a little slighted.
Why was not the happy birth planned for their
capital? they asked. Nevertheless, they sent a
goodly tribute of 100,000 gold florins to the cradle
of the little Prince, and saluted him as “Vicomte
d’Aix.”</p>

<p>The year 1404 had seasons of peculiar sorrow for
the Angevine Court, followed, happily, by joyous
days. On May 19 the King-Duke’s brother, Charles,
Duke of Maine and Count of Guise, died suddenly at
Angers,&mdash;the “Black Death” they called his malady,&mdash;amid
universal regret. He had been content to
play a subordinate rôle in the affairs of State&mdash;a man
more addicted to scholarly pursuits than political
activities. He had, however, proved himself the son
of a good mother and the stay of his young sister-in-law
from Aragon during her spouse’s absence from
his own dominions. The Duke left one only child&mdash;a
boy&mdash;who succeeded him as Charles II. of Maine.
Queen-Duchess Marie felt her dear son’s untimely
death acutely, and, notwithstanding the loving care
of her devoted daughter-in-law, she never recovered
from the prostration of her grief. Within a fortnight
of the obsequies of her son, the feet of those
who had so sorrowfully borne his body forth to
burial were treading the same mournful path, tenderly
bearing her own funeral casket.</p>

<p>Ever since her happy marriage to Louis I. in
1360, Marie de Châtillon-Blois had borne nobly her
part as the worthy helpmeet of her spouse and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>the
devoted mother of his children. For ten years after
his death her gentle presence and wise counsels had
directed the affairs of the House of Sicily-Anjou, and
smoothed away all difficulties from the path of her
son. She left immense wealth, which, added to the
goodly fortune of Louis I., made her son the richest
Sovereign in all France. It was said at the time
that she was worth “more than twenty-two millions
of livres.” “In spite of reputed avarice and hoarding,“
said a not too friendly historian, ”she was a
sapient ruler, moderate and firm, and she left Anjou
the better for a good example.” “<i>Sachiez</i>,” wrote
Bourdigne of her, “<i>que c’estoit une dame de goût
faiet, et de moult grant ponchas, car point ne dormoit
en poursuivant ses besoignes</i>.”</p>

<p>These dark clouds hung heavily over Louis II. and
Yolande, but the cause of their passing was a
signal of enthusiastic joy. On October 14 a little
baby-girl was born. Mary, the “Mother of Sorrows,”
heard the prayer of the stricken Royal Family, and
sent a new Mary to fill the place of the lamented
Duchess; for the child was named Marie simply,
and was offered to St. Mary for her own.</p>

<p>Troubles, however, were gathering thickly all over
the devoted land of France. The enemy in the gate,
ever victorious, plundered and pauperized every State
in turn, so that the country was “like a sheep bleating
helplessly before her shearers.” Tax-gatherers and
oppressors of mankind beggared the poor and feeble,
and spoiled the rich and brave. “<i>Sà de l’argent?
Sà de l’argent?</i>”&mdash;“Where’s your money?”&mdash;was the
desolating cry which the rough <i>cailloux</i> of the village
<i>pavé</i> tossed through the draughty doorways of
peasant cottages, and the smooth courtyards echoed
through the mullioned windows of seigneurs’ castles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>.
The gatherings, in spite of rape and rapine, fell far
short of the requirements of these times of stress, and
a general appeal was made to Queens and <i>châtelaines</i>
to exercise their charms in staying the hands of
ravishers. The famous answer of Queen Isabeau
was that, alas! of Queen Yolande, though more
sympathetically expressed: “<i>Je suis une povre voix
criant dans ce royaume, désireuse de paix et du bien
de tous!</i>”<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_3" id="Footnote_A_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_3"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> “I am a poor voice crying helplessly in this wretched kingdom,
seeking only peace and the good of all.”</p>

</div>

<p>This aptly expressed the weary sense of disaster
which saw that fateful year expire, but for the King
and Queen of Sicily-Anjou-Provence a gleam of the
brightness of Epiphany fell athwart their marital
couch. Yolande was for the third time a mother,
and her child was a boy. Born on January 6, 1408,
in a crenellated tower of the castle gateway of Angers,
his mother had to bear the anxiety and the vigil all
alone, for Louis II. was in Italy fighting for his own.</p>

<p>As before the birth of the Princess Marie devotions
had been addressed to the Mother of God and to
the saints for a favourable carriage, now, in view of
the troubles of the land, special petitions were
addressed to the most popular saint of Anjou, St.
Renatus, that the new deliverance might presage a
new birth of hope for France, and that the holy one,&mdash;the
patron of child-bearing mothers who sought
male heirs,&mdash;might supplicate at the throne of heaven
for a baby-boy.</p>

<p>Baptized in the Cathedral of St. Maurice eight
days after birth, the little Prince had for sponsors no
foreign potentates, but men of good renown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> and substance
in Anjou: Pierre, Abbé de St. Aubin; Jean,
Seigneur de l’Aigle; Guillaume, Chevalier des
Roches; and Mathilde, Abbée de Nôtre Dame
d’Angers. The Queen by proxy named her child
“René&mdash;<i>reconnaissance à Messire St. Renatus</i>.”</p>

<p>The Queen folded her little infant to her breast,
but after weaning him she gave him over to the
care of a faithful nurse, one Théophaine la Magine of
Saumur, who came to love him, and he her, most
tenderly.</p>

<p>Among the <i>documens historiques</i> of Anjou are
<i>Les Comptes de Roi René</i>&mdash;notices of public works
carried out in various parts of the royal-ducal
dominions. Many of these enterprises were undertaken
at the direct instance of Queen Yolande, and
they throw a strong light upon her character as a
loyal spouse and sapient ruler. For example, on
July 26, 1408, a <i>marché</i>, or contract, was made
between the Queen’s Council and one Julien Guillot,
a master-builder, for reslating the roof of the living
apartments and the towers of the Castle of Angers,
and also of various public buildings in the city, and
the manor-houses of Diex-Aye and de la Roche au
Due, at an upset price of fifty-five <i>livres tournois</i>
(standard gold coins), “to be paid when the work is
complete, with twenty more as deposit.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p class="caption">From “L’Album Historique de France”</p>

<p class="captionright"><i>To face page 60</i></p>

</div>

<p>Again, under date October 25, 1410, another
<i>marché</i> was signed, whereby “Jean Dueceux and
Jean Butort, master-carpenters of Angers, agree to
strengthen the woodwork of the castle chapel and
replace worn-out corbels. All to be finished against
the Feast of the Magdalen, at a total cost of two
hundred <i>livres tournois</i>, according to the order of
Queen Yolande and her Council.” King Louis had
in 1403 assigned a benefaction of twenty-five gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
livres to the ancient chapel of St. John Baptist,
to be paid yearly for ever, as a thank-offering for the
birth of Princess Marie.</p>

<p>These <i>documens</i> are full of such notices, and they
also record events of festive interest. One such
incident had a most ludicrous dénouement: “On the
twenty-seventh of June, 1409, Messire Yovunet
Coyrant, Superintendent of the Castle of Angers, paid
a visit of inspection, and he complained that on
Sunday, June 23rd of this month, being within the
said castle, where a merry company was occupied
with games and drolleries before Queen Yolande and
the Court, he stood for a time to watch the fun.
Quite unknown to him, the tails of his new long coat,
which had cost him ten solz [half a livre], were cut off
by some miscreant or other, whereby he became an
object of derision! For this insult he claimed satisfaction,
and named as his go-betweens Guye Buyneart
and Jehan Guoynie.” Whether these practical
jokers were inspired by the Queen we know not, but
this trifling record shows that she was not entirely
absorbed by the heavy responsibilities of her rank as
Lieutenant-General of her consort, but found time to
indulge in some of the gaieties which had been the
joy of her mother and herself in Aragon, and which
had graced her own nuptials and entry into Anjou
and Provence.</p>

<p>Again the mirthful pursuits of the Court and
country were stayed by the stringency of the times.
Sedition spread its baneful influence all over Provence
and Languedoc what time King Louis was still far
away fighting in Italy. With courage, fraught with
love and assurance, she set off to the distant province,
taking with her, not only an escort of dough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>ty war-lords,
but also her own tender nurslings&mdash;Louis,
Marie, and René. With her children was also the
young Princess Catherine, daughter of Jean “sans
Peur,” the Duke of Burgundy, whose betrothal to
her eldest son Louis was imminent. Through his
children her appeal would first be made to her
husband’s disaffected subjects. Should that fail, then
she could don cuirass and casque and head her royal
troops to worst them. With little Vicomte d’Aix
upon her saddle-lap, she passed through village, town,
and city, receiving enthusiastic plaudits everywhere;
she was “<i>Madame la Nostre Royne</i>!” The head of
the rebellion was scotched, and from Aix the intrepid
Queen despatched messengers to the King to tell of
her success, and to say that she was ready to embark
at once to his assistance.</p>

<p>This heroic offer was made possible by the death
of King Martin of Aragon in 1410, who bequeathed
to his niece the whole of his private fortune. This
event, however, added to the Queen’s anxieties, for
she was not the sort of woman to allow the royal
succession to pass for ever unchallenged. <i>La Justicia
Mayor</i> of the State of Aragon assembled at the
ancient royal castle of Alcañiz to receive the names
and to adjudicate the claims of candidates for the
vacant throne. Yolande, still styling herself “Queen
of Aragon,” was represented by Louis, Duke of
Bourbon, and Antoine, Count of Vendôme. Her
claim was not immediately for herself, but for her
son Louis. Two years were spent in acrimonious
deliberations, but the provisions of the Salic Law
penalized the female descent, and consequently the
next male heir, Prince Ferdinand of Castile, placed
the crown of Aragon upon his head as well a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>s that
of Castile. Queen Yolande had to be content with
her protest and her titular sovereignty.</p>

<p>Back at Angers in 1413, the Queen conceived a
notable future for her nine-years-old daughter,
Marie. Of the six sons of Charles VI. of France
and Isabeau, only one survived, the fifth-born,
Charles. The imperious Bavarian Queen had little
or none of Queen Yolande’s fondness for her
offspring; they were born, alas! put out to nurse,
forgotten, and neglected&mdash;so they died. Upon the
little Prince&mdash;the cherished jewel of his father&mdash;Queen
Yolande fixed her motherly regard. He was
a year older than her Marie, and a piteous little
object bereft of a mother’s love and solicitude.
Yolande’s warm heart yearned towards the lonely
child; she would mother him, she would train him,
and then she would marry him to Marie&mdash;this was
the Queen’s dream.</p>

<p>With that promptitude which marked all her
well-considered actions, Queen Yolande set about
the realization of her castle in the air. She again
packed up herself, her children, and her Court, and
took up her abode in the Château de Mehun-sur-Yèvre,
near Bourges, a favourite residence of the
French Court. Among her little ones was a baby-girl,
no more than six months old&mdash;Yolande, her
own name-child. She gave as her reason for so
strange a line of conduct her wish for greater facilities
in the education of her children. Charles VI. offered
no objection to the residence of such a worthy mother
and heroine wife in his own neighbourhood; indeed,
he regarded her advent with considerable pleasure
and satisfaction. Yolande’s influence for good would
outweigh Isabeau’s for evil; besides, she would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
a trusty counsellor.</p>

<p>Queen Yolande had not been very long established
at Mehun before she put in a plea on behalf of the
poor little heir to the throne of France. Charles
was thankful, he was delighted, and at once gave
into her sole charge, untrammelled in any way, his
dear little son, to share the home care and the
studies of his two young cousins, Louis and René
d’Anjou. Having obtained the charge of the little
Count de Ponthieu, Queen Yolande once more went
home to Angers, by no means embarrassed by the
fact that she had assumed the training of two Kings,
Louis and Charles, with René a possible King of
Aragon besides.</p>

<p>For two years Charles passed for Yolande’s son,
the playmate and boy-lover of her sweet Marie. All
his inspirations and his examples he took from her
and them&mdash;at last a happy boy, with a hopeful
future. The Queen allowed that future no halting
steps; Charles and Marie should be betrothed, and
Mary should be Queen of France! Yolande broached
the subject to King Charles, and at once gained
his cordial consent, but tactfully she left to him the
furthering of the project. Upon December 18, 1415,
Charles of France and Marie of Sicily-Anjou were
privately affianced in the Royal Chapel of the Castle
of Bourges. France was in the throes of revolution
and dissolution; the terrible defeat at Azincourt, on
October 24 that same year, had paralyzed the
military power of the French States, and was the
ultimate cause of King Charles’s insanity. For
seven years he became a fugitive, not only bereft
of reason, but of all resources. Queen Isabeau did
nothing to relieve the tension, but maintained her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
irreconcilable position, and continued her ill-living.
The King’s only brother, the lamented Duke of
Orléans, had been assassinated eight years before,
and there appeared to be no one capable of steering
the ship of State into a calm haven.</p>

<p>This was Queen Yolande’s opportunity, and she
rose to its height majestically. She was already
guardian of the Dauphin, who after his espousal
returned with his child-bride to Angers. Now she
assumed the general direction of affairs, and became
virtually Regent of France and the arbiter of her
destiny. She personally approached the English
King, and obtained from him favourable terms of
peace, which assured tranquillity and regeneration for
France. She it was who proposed to Henry his
alliance with her young goddaughter, Catherine,
the youngest child of Charles VI. and Isabeau, then
fourteen years of age. He was twenty-eight, and
the marriage was consummated five years later,
although Henry’s terms included the payment of the
arrears of the ransom of King John the “Good,” the
prisoner of Poitiers, a sum of 2,000,000 crowns.</p>

<p>The Queen’s judgment and resourcefulness eminently
merited the grudging encomium of the wife of
her husband’s fiercest rival, the Duchess of Burgundy.
“I am always glad,” she said, “when it is
a good woman who governs, for then all good men
follow her!”</p>

<p>All this time,&mdash;a time fraught with infinite issues,&mdash;King
Louis II. of Sicily-Anjou was in Italy, meeting
in his campaign with varied fortune. He had all
he could do to hold his own, but his presence at the
head of his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>army was essential to ultimate success.
Three times he entered Naples acclaimed as King, for
Queen Giovanna II. had named him so. Three times
he fled discomfited after victory, which he failed
to follow up. He rarely returned to his French
dominions, and really he had no necessity so to do
on the score of administration, for his beloved and
capable Lieutenant-General was perfectly able to
keep everything in order and uphold his authority.
At last the King of Sicily-Anjou and Naples returned
to Angers a broken and an ailing man, to
spend what time Providence would still grant him
with his devoted noble wife.</p>

<p>Queen Yolande’s first great grief came to her in
1417, when her faithful husband was taken from
her. Happily for them both, they were united at
the deathbed&mdash;consoling and consoled. He was
young to die&mdash;barely forty years of age&mdash;but ripe
enough for the greedy grasp of Death. Louis II.’s
fame was that of a “loyal Sovereign, a righteous
man, a true spouse, and an affectionate father.”</p>

<span class="smaller">YOLANDA D’ARRAGONA&mdash;“A GOOD MOTHER AND A
GREAT QUEEN”&mdash;<i>continued</i></span></h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>A royal corpse reposed upon the state tester bedstead
within the great Hall of Audiences in the
enceinte of the Castle of Angers, and a royal widow
knelt humbly at a prie-dieu at his feet. It was late
in the evening of that sweet April day,&mdash;half sun,
half shower,&mdash;that the body of Louis II., King of
Sicily, Naples, Jerusalem, and Anjou, was ceremonially
displayed, flanked by huge yellow wax candles in
chiselled sticks of Gerona brasswork. The tapestried
walls of this <i>chapelle ardente</i> were covered with sable
cloth sewn with silver lilies and hung with great
garlands of yew. The head of the lamented Sovereign
reposed upon a soft cushion of blue velvet, put
there by the widow herself. Upon his breast, with
its pectoral cross, was his favourite “<i>Livre des
Heures</i>,” one of the famous treasures of the collection
of King John the “Good,” his grandfather.</p>

<p>In her black velvet <i>chapelle</i>, with its close gauze
veil concealing her beautiful hair, and attired in
sombre black, unrelieved, the devotional figure, sorrowful
and brave, was none other than “Good” Queen
Yolande. Her right hand rested consolingly upon
the shoulder of her eldest son, now Louis III., a
well-grown stripling of fourteen. Around his neck
his mother had but just hung the chain and medallion
of sovereignty, taken tenderly from her dead spouse.
Behind them knelt Prince René and Princess <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>Marie,
the fondest of playmates, weeping bitterly, poor
children! The vast hall was filled with courtiers,
soldiers, citizens, all manifesting signs of woe and
regret. The royal obsequies were conducted magnificently,
under the personal direction of the Queen,
within the choir of the Cathedral of St. Maurice.
Feuds of rival Sovereigns, operations against the
foreign foe, quarrels of fault-finders, and the like,
were all hushed in the presence of the King of
Terrors. To Angers thronged royal guests and
simple folk to pay their last tributes of respect and
devotion. In state, King Charles VI. started to
tender his homage to the dead, but, struck down
with sudden illness at Orléans, he requested Queen
Isabeau to take his place. Burial rites were not
much in that giddy woman’s way, and her hard
heart had no room for sympathy and condolence; so
the “Scourge of France,” as she was called, gave
Angers a wide berth.</p>

<p>The Angevine royal children were five in number,
and Louis left besides a natural son,&mdash;Louis de
Maine, Seigneur de Mezières,&mdash;and a natural
daughter,&mdash;Blanche,&mdash;whom René, when he attained
his father’s throne in 1434, married to the Sieur
Pierre de Biège. The defunct King’s will appointed
four simple knights,&mdash;his henchmen true,&mdash;executors:
Pierre de Beauvais and Guy de Laval for Anjou, and
Barthélèmy and Gabriel de Valorey for Provence,
with Hardoyn de Bueil, Bishop of Angers, as
moderator. The Queen-mother was constituted
Regent of the kingdoms and dominions and guardian
of the young King, whilst Prince René was commended,
under his father’s will, to the charge of his
great-uncle Louis, Cardinal and Duke de Bar, wi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>th

<p>The loss of her second son and the parting of the
brothers was a sore trial to the whole family. The
Cardinal, however, insisted upon his young nephew
being sent to him at Bar-le-Duc, to be educated under
his eye and prepared for his destiny as future Duke of
Bar, which the Cardinal caused to be announced both
in Anjou and Barrois. Louis de Bar was a very
distinguished ecclesiastic; he had passed through
every grade of Holy Order with rare distinction. In
1391 the Pope conferred upon him the bishopric of
Poitiers, and two years later translated him to
Langres, with the Sees also of Châlons and Verdun.
The latter dignity carried with it the degree of
Grand Peer of France, and in those days Bishops
were regarded as temporal Sovereigns within the
jurisdiction of their Sees. Benedict XIII. in 1397
preconized Louis de Bar Cardinal-Bishop, and
named him Papal Legate in France and Germany.
His temporal honours as Duke of Bar came to him
in 1415, after the calamitous battle of Azincourt, in
which his two elder brothers, Édouard and Jehan,
fell gloriously. Their untimely deaths and disasters
keen and sad brought about, too, the death of good
Duke Robert, their father. He died of a broken
heart, whilst Duchess Marie shut herself up in a
convent, and was never known again to smile. Her
death has not been recorded.</p>

<p>After bidding adieu to her dearly loved son,&mdash;perhaps
her favourite child, and most like herself in
temperament and character,&mdash;Queen Yolande, with
the young King, was fully occupied in receiving
addresses of condolence and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>assurances of loyalty both
at Angers and at Aix, to which they made a progress
in full state. She assumed the personal direction of
affairs, appointing tactfully as assessors the most
prominent men of all classes in both domains. In a
very distinct sense she was a democratic Sovereign,
and under her régime the Estates were allowed a
good deal of independent action in matters, at least,
of local policy. Thus, by maintaining the dignity of
the crown of Sicily-Anjou-Provence and encouraging
popular government, Queen Yolande initiated the
first free constitution in the history of all France.</p>

<p>The stability of the throne and the welfare of its
subjects having been secured, the Queen turned her
attention to the matrimonial prospect of her eldest
son. Some years before King Louis’s death, Jean
“sans Peur,” Duke of Burgundy,&mdash;in days when the
Courts of Angers and Dijon saw eye to eye, and the
States were not rivals in the direction of the general
policy of the French Sovereigns,&mdash;had confided his
little daughter Catherine to the charge of the eminent
Queen of Sicily-Anjou, to be brought up with her
own girls, the Princesses Marie and Yolande. Then
the idea of the betrothal of Louis d’Anjou and
Catherine de Bourgogne was accepted as a very
excellent mutual arrangement; indeed, the Duke had
named his intention of dowering the Princess with
50,000 <i>livres tournois</i> (= <i>circa</i> £30,000), besides
placing the castle at the disposal of the young couple
upon the consummation of the marriage.</p>

<p>There had arisen coolness and suspicion between
the Sovereigns of France and the Duke of Burgundy,
whose connection with the assassination of the Duke
of Orléans, in 1407, had never been cleared up. The
Duke, moreover, had seen good,&mdash;in vie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>w of his
professed claims to the crown of France,&mdash;to make
terms with the King of England which would, under
certain circumstances, gain territorial aggrandizement
for Burgundy, and ultimately the reversion to his
family of the royal title. This <i>rapprochement</i> with
the hated invader of Northern France,&mdash;the foe at the
gates of Anjou,&mdash;lead summarily to the renunciation
by the Angevine Sovereigns of all matrimonial
affinities between the Houses of Anjou and Burgundy.
Little Princess Catherine was sent home to Dijon,
and the Duke scouted the Anjou alliance, and made
terms with Lorraine, a step which in another decade
told disastrously against the son of Queen Yolande.</p>

<p>She, on the other hand, cared very little for the
change of front of Duke Jean “sans Peur.” Her
mind had all along been made up in the matter of her
son’s betrothal, and her eyes were turned to Brittany,
whose Sovereigns were the most stable and the most
powerful in France. The dual crown of Sicily-Anjou
was rich, and the prospects of the new
occupant of that throne with respect to Naples, and
possibly to Aragon, were of the highest; consequently
the matrimonial market was absolutely at her command.
Politically it was clear that an alliance of
Anjou and Brittany would more than balance that
of Burgundy and Lorraine. Very tactfully the
Angevine Queen-mother caused her “cousin” at
Nantes to know that a nuptial arrangement between
her son and a daughter of Duke Jean VI. would
be favourably considered at Angers. To pave the
way more auspiciously, splendid fêtes were organized
at the castle, to which the ducal family of Brittany
were invited as principal guests of honour. The
Duke and Duchess were accompanied by their
young daughter, Princess Isabelle, and were g<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>reatly
affected by their reception. In the tournaments,
pageants, and floral games, the young Bretagne
Princes gained all the laurels, whilst the blushing
Princess, as the “Queen of Beauty,” bestowed the
prizes upon the victors.</p>

<p>On July 3 a royal function in the Cathedral of
Angers brought the fêtes to an auspicious finish, for
there Louis d’Anjou and Isabelle de Bretagne were
formally espoused, the young couple being of the
same age. Alas for the hopes of all concerned! the
Princess,&mdash;a very beautiful and an accomplished girl,&mdash;was
not destined to wear the Queen-consort’s crown
of Sicily-Anjou. Before the year was out she
sickened of plague,&mdash;as captious critics said, caught
in “Black Angers,”&mdash;and died. This was a serious
blow to Queen Yolande’s diplomacy, but she was
not the sort of woman to waste time in unprofitable
lamentations.</p>

<p>By the force of circumstances, seen and unseen,
the Queen-mother’s search for favourable alliances
and an eligible consort for her son was greatly aided
by the fresh aggression of the English under Henry V.
In face of the common danger, which threatened
alike the western and the eastern States of France,
Queen Yolande found her opportunity of immensely
strengthening the position of her son’s dominions by
detaching Burgundy and Lorraine from the English
alliance. At Saumur she signed the articles of a
defensive and offensive treaty between the four great
duchies,&mdash;Bretagne, of course, being one,&mdash;<i>La Ligue
de Quatre</i>, it was called.</p>

<p>Next to the assurance of political security at
home, this instrument set the astute Queen free <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>to
turn her attention to the support of her son’s claims
to the throne of Naples. First appertaining to the
older line of Anjou in the person and descendants
of Jehan, brother of St. Louis, they had lapsed
until King Louis I. of Sicily-Anjou asserted his right
as head of the younger line of Anjou in virtue of the
grant by his father, King John the “Good.” These
prerogatives, alas! Louis II. had lost the year he
died, and their reacquisition was the destiny of his
son. In furtherance of these duties, Queen Yolande
conceived that an Italian alliance, with the corollary
of a matrimonial contract for the young King, were
indicated, and she set to work to elaborate a scheme
which should achieve the ends in view.</p>

<p>In September, 1418, Queen Yolande opened
negotiations directly with Amadeo VIII., Duke of
Savoy, first for his assistance in the field of battle, and
next for the betrothal of his daughter Margherita,
then an infant of three years old. A treaty was
signed on October 18, wherein the Duke agreed to
receive young King Louis in Savoy, and either
personally to accompany him through the proposed
campaign, or at least to see his embarkation at
Genoa at the head of a Savoyard contingent of ten
thousand men-at-arms, for the recovery of the crown
of Naples. One clause ceded the county of Nice to
Savoy in lieu of moneys borrowed by Louis II. for
his Naples expedition. Appended to this treaty was
the marriage contract, which appointed Chambéry,&mdash;the
capital of Savoy,&mdash;as the place, and Lady Day
the following year as the date, for the formal espousal
of Louis and Margherita.</p>

<p>Steps were at once taken for the young King to
enter upon his expedition in a manner suited to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
rank and commensurate with the military movements
of the time. Angers once more resounded to the
metallic music of armourers. A Guild of Sword-Cutlers
was incorporated, and skilled craftsmen
from Aragon were again welcomed by the Queen.
Masters of Arms, too, were invited to give Louis
the best instruction in warlike exercises, Yolande
herself meanwhile inculcating lessons of hardihood,
chivalry, and patriotism. Hers, happily, was the
satisfaction of knowing that these efforts were
productive of the best results, for the youthful
Sovereign quickly became an expert and an enthusiast.</p>

<p>It does not appear that the young King took
much interest in the matrimonial part of the negotiations.
An unripe boy of sixteen would naturally
be very much more affected by military prowess than
by uxorious daintiness. The service of Mars was
very much more to his liking than that of Venus,
and he addressed himself zealously to the task of
winning back his grandfather’s crown and sceptre,
which his father had failed to retain. It was doubtless
a daring enterprise for a youth to undertake,
but we may be quite sure that he inherited not
a little of his family’s well known fearlessness.
Province was denuded of her garrisons, and Languedoc
also; but no men could be spared from Anjou and
Bar, and it was but the nucleus of an army which
Queen Yolande reviewed at Marseilles, whither she
went to bid adieu to her dearly loved son upon his
adventurous career.</p>

<p>Louis sailed for Genoa, where he met the Duke of
Savoy and took command of his contingent. He
anchored in the Bay of Naples on August 15, 1420,
a day full of favourable omens. On the voyage he
fell in with the fleet of the King of Aragon, his rival
for the crown of Naples, and worsted it. At once he
went off to Aversa, where the Queen of Naples,
Giovanna II., received him with open arms. His
<i>naïveté</i> delighted her, jaded as she was with the
attentions of willing and unwilling aspirants for her
favours. She created him Duke of Calabria, and
proclaimed him her heir in lieu of the defeated and
discredited Alfonso.</p>

<p>It was a perilous position for the vigorous and
gallant stripling Prince, but the counsels of his
virtuous mother were not thrown away. The young
King refused the amorous royal overtures successfully,
and having kissed the Queen’s hand, he offered
a plausible excuse, and speedily took his departure for
Rome. The Supreme Pontiff extended to the
youthful hero his paternal benediction, and detained
him at the Vatican just long enough to invest him
with the title of King of Naples, in place, as His Holiness
wished, of the worthless and abandoned Queen.
Thence Louis travelled on to Florence and Milan,
and obtained promises of substantial assistance from
their rulers against the pretensions of the King of
Aragon.</p>

<p>But to return to Anjou and the “good mother”
there, the anxious and busy Queen Yolande.</p>

<p>The <i>Revue Numismatique du Maine</i> contains
many paragraphs recounting the Queen’s prudence
and activity in military matters. Under date June 10,
1418, for example, she issued an order to the
Seneschal and Treasurer of Provence “to reimburse
one Jehan Crepin, keeper of the Castle of Forcalquier,
whence one of the sovereign titles are taken, the
advance made by him for the reparation of the s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>aid
castle.” On February 18, 1419, the States of
Provence assembled at Aix besought the Queen, as
head of the State, “to suppress the tax which had
been levied upon the circulation of foreign money,
with a view to greater facilities being accorded for
the payment of sums required for the defence of the
country.” A few years later,&mdash;in 1427,&mdash;the authorities
of the city of Marseilles prayed the Queen, then
at Tarascon, to authorize them to impose a poll-tax
upon all foreign merchants in the port, “so that the
funds at their command might be enlarged, for the
express purpose of fitting out vessels of war.” The
inhabitants of Martignes, which county Yolande had
brought, on her marriage, to the possessions of her
husband,&mdash;on December 20, 1419,&mdash;sought for their
Queen-Countess, as ruler and administrator, the right
to retain certain dues on the production of salt for the
defence of their coast-line. There are very many
such entries in the State papers of the reign; indeed,
both before and after the departure of Louis III. for
Naples, Queen Yolande was recognized as responsible
ruler for her son.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>If Louis’s matrimonial prospects were somewhat
clouded by the extreme youth of his child-bride,
the Queen was by no means discouraged in her
policy of influential alliances. Her second son, René,
who had won all hearts in Barrois, was actually
married to Princess Isabelle of Lorraine in 1420,
although she was no more than nine years old, and he
but twelve. This match was, however, not wholly
the work of Queen Yolande; her ideas, however,
were those which impelled her uncle, Cardinal Louis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
de Bar, directly to ask the hand of the juvenile
Princess.</p>

<p>The year before this precocious marriage the
Cardinal had formally proclaimed René his heir to
the duchy of Bar, and created him Marquis of
Pont-à-Mousson. This action greatly displeased
Arnould, Duke of Berg, whose wife was Marie de
Bar, a sister of the Cardinal. She preferred claims
to the succession as next of kin to her brother, and
when she was refused, the Duke took up arms and
advanced upon Bar-le-Duc. The movement failed,
and young René saw the Duke’s dead body taken
away for burial without emotion. The young Prince
had been for nearly two years residing at his great-uncle’s
castle, under his immediate care and instruction.
Among the tutors chosen for his training were
Maestre Jehan de Proviesey, a grammarian and
Latinist, and Maestre Antoine de la Salle, poet and
musician. Such instructors were <i>de rigueur</i>, of
course, for the true development of a perfect gentleman
and courtier. The latter master wrote a treatise
entitled “<i>Les quinze joyes de la mariage: instructions
addressés aux jeunes hommes</i>.” This he dedicated to
his pupil, Prince René. Among the quaint aphorisms
it contains, this must have caused more than a smile
on the part of the young knight:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Bon cheval, mauvais cheval, veut l’esperon;</div>
<div class="verse">Bonne femme, mauvaise femme, veut le baston!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the pith of the treatise is expressed in the
neat quintet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Quattuor sunt que mulieres summe cupiunt,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
<div class="verse">A formis amari juvenibus,</div>
<div class="verse">Pottere fillis pluribus</div>
<div class="verse">Ornari preciosis vestibus</div>
<div class="verse">Et dominari pre ceteris in domibus.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>René’s time was, however, not wholly absorbed by
his studies in school and Court, for he bestrode his
warhorse like a man, and rode forth by his great-uncle’s
side on punitive expeditions against recalcitrant
vassals and against the incursions of freebooters,
who under the designation of “<i>Soudoyers</i>” were devastating
the duchy. It was said of the Cardinal:
“<i>Il savait au besoin porter ung bassinet pour mitre
et pour croix d’or un tache d’acier</i>!”</p>

<p>Directly Duke Robert died, and the succession fell
to an ecclesiastic, the dissatisfied subjects of the
Barrois crown considered it a favourable opportunity
for throwing off their allegiance. Jean de Luxembourg,
a cousin of the widowed Duchess Marie, and
Robert de Sarrebouche,&mdash;at the extreme limits of the
territories of the duchy,&mdash;were perhaps the most
conspicuous for their infidelity. The Cardinal-Duke
struck home at once, and both rebels surrendered.
In the case of the latter, Prince René was put forward
to receive his submission, on his great-uncle’s
behalf. The “proud Sieur de Commercy,” as he was
called, was compelled to kneel in the market-place of
Commercy before the boy-knight, and, putting his
great hands between the tender palms of his Prince,
obliged to swear as <i>vostre homme et vostre vassail</i>!
The Prince’s bearing in this his first military campaign
was beyond all praise, and the Cardinal was
delighted with his chivalry. The Duke of Lorraine
sent to compliment him upon his courage, and his
doting mother, Queen Yolande, held a ten-days
festival at Angers, and rang all the church bells in
honour of her son’s baptism of blood.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>
<p>These exploits caused the youthful hero to carry
himself proudly, and greatly increased his self-conceit.
This latter development had an amusing and yet a
very natural sequel. The Prince with his own hand,
under the instruction of Maestre Jehan de Proviesey,
wrote letters to all the leading men of Angers, Provence,
Barrois, and Lorraine, in which he enlarged
upon the boldness of his conduct; and inditing sententious
maxims, he sought their approbation and
good-will. The Cardinal-Duke doubtless smiled good-humouredly
at these juvenile effusions, but at the
same time he reconstituted the Barrois knightly
“<i>Ordre de la Fidélité</i>,” which embraced as members
all the young French Princes, and created René de
Bar, as he was now called, first and principal Knight.
The Prince henceforward wore the motto of his Order
embroidered upon his <i>berretta</i> and chimere&mdash;“<i>Tout
Ung</i>”&mdash;and chose it as his <i>gage de guerre</i>.</p>

<p>Louis de Bar had, however, other duties and
pursuits to place before his favourite nephew. At
the Court of Dijon resided two famous Flemish
painters, brothers&mdash;Hubert and Jehan Van Eyck,
pensioners of the enlightened Duke of Burgundy.
By means of bribes and other influences brought to
bear, they were induced to remove to Bar-le-Duc,
and with them came Petrus Christus and other
pupils. Keen patron of the arts and crafts, the
Cardinal-Duke encouraged his principal courtiers and
vassals to send their sons to them for instruction in
the art of painting. The first pupil enrolled in
Barrois upon the books of the Van Eycks was none
other than Prince René, and no pupil showed greater
talent and greater perseverance. His uncle once said
to him: “René, if thou wast not destined to succeed
me as Duke of Bar and leader of her armies, I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
make of thee an artist.” In his veins, we must
remember, ran Flemish blood,&mdash;his famous and
talented ancestress, the Countess-Princess Iolande,
came from Flanders,&mdash;and these excellent pigment
masters appear to have stirred qualities in the young
Prince which eventually proclaimed him the foremost
royal artist in Europe.</p>

<p>The Cardinal also inculcated in his nephew the love
and taste for objects of beauty. He was himself a
proficient in the craft of goldsmithery, and, moreover,
possessed a very magnificent collection of gold
and silver work. Part of this had come to him from
his mother, Duchess Marie of France, who took to
Bar her share of her father’s treasures, the good King
John. Of these, the Cardinal presented to Pope
John XXIII. in 1414 a writing-table made of cedar,
covered with plates of solid gold, and the superb gold
chalice and paten which are still used in the Papal
chapel at Rome at special Masses by His Holiness
himself. Another precious goblet, mounted with
sapphires and rubies, was bequeathed to the Cardinal’s
sister, the Princess Bonne, Countess of Ligny.</p>

<p class="captionright"><i>To face page 80.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The ducal gardens at Bar-le-Duc were famous.
The Cardinal sent to Italy for skilled gardeners, who
reproduced something of the terrestrial glories of that
favoured land. Tuscan sculptors and Venetian decorative
painters followed in the wake of the gardeners,
who not only designed architectural terraces with
marble statues and garden-pavilions with painted
ceilings, but also designed and minted medals and
plaques of the Cardinal, Prince René, and other
members of the family. Naturally, the young Hereditary
Duke revelled in these graceful settings for the
floral games and festive pastimes which made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Barrois Court, even in the absence of a reigning
Duchess, the rendezvous of poets, gallants, and
beauties. Here, too, the Prince’s natural love for
music had full play; he became a poet and a troubadour
“in little,” if not in “great.” In a very real
kind of way René’s training in the arts of war and in
the arts of peace was the very same which made a
Lorenzo de’ Medici at Florence and a Francesco
Sforza at Milan.</p>

<p>Amid all these occupations, the Prince had few
opportunities for visiting his birthplace, Angers, and
his devoted mother there. Travelling was very
insecure, and the Cardinal disparaged any expedition
beyond the bounds of the duchy. Only one such
visit is recorded, and that in 1422, when René took
his absent brother’s place to give away his favourite
sister Marie to Charles VII. of France, and then
Queen Yolande once more embraced her son. On
the other hand, the Prince was permitted by his uncle
to vigorously assist King Charles against Louis de
Châlons, Prince of Orange, who was devastating
Dauphiné. In another direction the young warrior
gained laurels also. Named protector of the city of
Verdun, he destroyed the rebel castle of Renancourt
and the fortresses of La Ferté, and hastened to the
assistance of his kinsman, the Count of Ligny, at
Baumont en Argonne. Guillaume de Flavy and
Jehan de Mattaincourt surrendered, and René cleared
the country of disaffected marauders and adventurers.</p>

<p>Charles V.’s speech at the siege of Metz one
hundred years later might very well have fitted the
youthful conqueror in Barrois: “Fortune is a
woman: she favours only the young.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Queen Yolande’s eldest son, Louis III., was meanwhile
meeting with varying fortunes in Italy, but the
slow progress of his campaign greatly chagrined his
dauntless mother. She actually made up her mind
to set out for Naples in person to try and turn the
slow tide of victory into an overpowering flood; but
Anjou was too closely invested by the English for the
realization of her project. Here, however, the Queen
had her militant opportunity, for at the bloody battle
of Baugé,&mdash;between La Flèche and Saumur,&mdash;in
1421, the English were routed and so greatly disheartened
that they evacuated all their strategic
points within and around the duchy. That victory
was gained directly by Queen Yolande, who commanded
in person, sitting astride a great white
charger, clothed in steel and silver mail. Some years
later King René built an imposing castle upon the
heights overlooking the field of battle in memory of
his mother’s valour.</p>

<p>The Queen’s warlike ardour, however, received a
check, for Queen Marie, driven with King Charles
before the all-conquering English, escaped to Bourges,
and there begged her mother to hasten to her side.
She needed, not a mailed woman’s fist, but the gentle
hand of her good mother at her accouchement. Louis
le Dauphin, her first-born, saw the light in the Archbishop’s
Palace on July 3, 1423. Those days were
dark indeed for France, but a brilliant star was about
to rise above her eastern horizon. Towards the end
of 1428 strange reports began to spread all over the
stricken country concerning a simple village maiden in
far-off Champagne, to whom, in the obscure village of
Domremy, Divine visions had been vouchsafed. Her
mission, it was stated, was nothing less than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
deliverance of France and the coronation of King
Charles at Reims.</p>

<p>Nowhere did the mysterious tidings create greater
interest than among the members of the Royal Families
and Courts of Sicily-Anjou and France. When the
news of Jeanne d’Arc’s arrival with Duke René
reached Angers, Queen Yolande set out at once for
Chinon, that she might judge for herself of the girl
and her mission. Very greatly struck was the Queen
by the maid’s youth, comeliness, and innocence. Her
simple manners and unaffected devotion convinced
Yolande that she had no adventuress to deal with.
She conversed freely with her, and her simple narrative
and fearless courage determined her to take the
maid under her direct patronage. When it was
proposed to inquire formally into Jeanne’s character
and mental bias, the Queen promptly allocated to herself
that duty. She called to her assistance three
ladies of her Court of good repute. Jehan Pasquerelle
has quaintly recorded this plenary council
of matrons: “<i>Fust icelle Pucelle baillée à la Royne
de Cecile, mère de la Royne, nostre souveraine, et à
certaines dames d’estant avec elle, dont estoient les
Dames de Gaucourt, de Fiennes, et de Trèves</i>.”
Another chronicler adds the name of Jeanne de
Mortèmar, wife of the Chancellor, Robert le Maçon.
Their verdict was a complete vindication of Jeanne’s
honour and sincerity.</p>

<p>The tongue of slander had associated René and
Jeanne in a liaison. The Court of Chinon was full
of evil gossip, and the more ill-conditioned courtiers
and hirelings, both men and women, revelled in compromising
insinuations and coar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>se jests. Queen
Yolande determined once and for all to put an end
to these baseless and foul rumours. She knew her
son too well to doubt his honour, and now she
pledged herself to defend that of the village maid.
Several of the offenders were dismissed the service
of the King, and warned to hold their tongue, unless
they wished for condign punishment.</p>

<p>History has done scant justice to Queen Yolande
for the part she bore in the drama of Jeanne d’Arc.
It was in a very great measure due to her that the
maid’s mission was carried out. Whilst Charles was
dallying with his idle associates and procrastinating in
his military measures, Yolande played the man. Her
intrepid counsels and fearless insistence were the
levers which moved her son-in-law’s inertness. There
is a story told that, when Queen Marie’s gentle
chiding had failed to rouse her desponding consort,
Queen Yolande appeared before him clothed in full
armour, and demanded why the King of France
skulked in his castle!</p>

<p>“See, Charles,” she said, “if you refuse to follow
<i>La Pucelle</i> at once and do your duty to God and to
your country, I will go forth as your lieutenant, and
in person lead your army against the English. But
shame to you to trust in a woman’s arm rather than
your own! Rouse you like a man, and begone!”</p>

<p>This emphatic order fairly called out Charles’s
manhood, roused, to be sure, by the mission of
Jeanne d’Arc. Nothing excites a man more than a
woman’s threats to take his place and do his work;
and many women can be as good as their word, and
one of these was Yolande of Sicily-Anjou-Aragon.</p>

<p>The noble patriotic Queen-mother, moreover,
backed her stout words by actions firm. With th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>at
splendid unselfishness which marked her character, she
raised a considerable sum of money by the sale of her
jewellery and other precious possessions, and applied it,
together with the substantial offerings of her devoted
subjects, to the fitting out of a convoy of provisions
and necessaries for the besieged garrison of Orléans.
She also persuaded the University of Angers, which
her late consort, Louis II., had founded in 1398, to
vote a goodly sum of money towards the King’s
expenses. Charles, stirred by the gentleness of
Jeanne and the vigour of Yolande, was no longer
despondent. The Queen thankfully noted his confidence
in his mysterious guide from Domremy, but
she remained at Chinon until she had seen him
and his equipage take boat upon the Loire. His
last words to his mother-in-law were: “Yes, now I
am on my way to Reims with Jeanne, my oracle, my
Queen&mdash;<i>ma Royne blanche: tous pour Dieu et la
France!</i>” Yolande then quietly returned to her castle
at Angers, and Anjou once more greeted the King’s
guardian and the Lieutenant-General of his dominions.</p>

<p>The decade had its consolations as well as its
troubles, and among them Queen Yolande rejoiced
at the births of vigorous grandchildren. To Queen
Marie were born Princesses Jeanne and Yolande, as
well as the Dauphin Louis; and to Duke René,
Jean, Louis, Nicholas, Yolande, and Marguerite, in
lawful wedlock. The Queen-mother, too, had satisfaction
in the less disturbed state of Barrois and
Lorraine, of receiving at Angers her son René and
his fair young wife Isabelle. He had added to the
bays of victory the palms of peace, and his fame as
an administrator of justice and charity was already
spread abroad.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>
<p>The Cardinal-Duke Louis was ageing rapidly, and
he executed his final testament whilst his nephew
and niece were in Anjou. Everything was left to
René, who had as much as he could do to get back
to Bar-le-Duc in time to receive his uncle’s last
blessing and close his eyes in death. The dying
Prince was at the Abbey of Varennes when he
breathed his last, on February 15, 1431. Duke
René was at once proclaimed his successor, and the
Estates of Barrois did their homage heartily. The
career of the young Duke had been developed under
the approving eyes of his uncle’s subjects, and his
marriage with Isabelle de Lorraine had been
immensely popular. The new reign opened, then,
under the happiest auspices.</p>

</div>

<p>René’s future being thus amply provided for,&mdash;his
hand was also on the throne of Lorraine,&mdash;Queen
Yolande turned her attention to the settlement in
life of her younger children&mdash;Yolande, just eighteen,
and Charles, two years younger. For her daughter,
whose espousal three years before to Jehan, Comte
d’Alençon, had not led to marriage, the Queen
sought once more an alliance with the House of
Bretagne. The Duke’s eldest son, François, Comte
de Montfort, who had been first champion at the
Angers tournament in 1417, was the chosen bridegroom.
He, indeed, had seen and played with the
Princess then, but she was a little child of five;
their betrothal, however, had been considered, and
only hindered by the military exigencies of the time.
The Prince was in person as handsome as could be,
and talented, but his character was not one that
Queen Yolande looked for in a son-in-law. More
addicted to warlike deeds and the free licence of a
soldier’s calling, he had little taste for peacefu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>l
pursuits, and still less for the restrictions of family
life. He was, like most Princes at the time, more or
less of a <i>débauché</i>, and his fair fame was besmirched
by sordid and licentious habits. Still, the Comte de
Montfort stood for political advantages, and questions
of character were counted of less importance. The
royal nuptials were celebrated in due course at the
Cathedral of St. Pierre at Nantes, the capital of
Brittany, on July 1, 1431, in the presence of Queen
Yolande and the Duke and Duchess of Barrois.
Alas! once more marriage proved a failure, for the
year following the home-coming of the Count and
Countess he was slain in a foray with the English,
leaving his childless young widow to bewail her
ill-luck alone.</p>

<p>The marriage of Prince Charles d’Anjou was
delayed many years, and his experience of the
vicissitudes of Cupid’s thraldom was almost identical
with that of King Louis III., his elder brother.
Affianced in 1431, at the same time as his sister
Yolande, to a daughter of Guy, Count of Laval,
his brother René’s bosom friend, and one of Jeanne
d’Arc’s <i>preux cavaliers</i>, another Yolande, he broke
off the match because the infant Princess,&mdash;she
but three years old,&mdash;was “so plain and weak.”
“Besides, I will not wait twelve years
for her.” He was himself just seventeen. The
baby-fiancée’s mother was a Bretagne princess,
Isabelle, a daughter of Queen Yolande’s great ally,
Duke Jehan VI. The young Prince had in his
mind another amour, perhaps hardly in his heart;
but he had seen and admired, when assisting at the
<i>sacre</i> of King Charles VII., his brother-in-law, at
Reims, a Princess of Champagne, and, much agai<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>nst
his mother’s wish, he bespoke her for his own. They
were betrothed at the ancient castle of Coucy, near
Soissons, in 1435. This match, too, came to
nothing, for the fair fiancée, Catherine, perished in
the flames of her boudoir curtains, set on fire by
accident, and left her young Prince of twenty-one free
to step along the uncertain path of courtship once
more. Such were some of the ups and downs of the
Queen of Sicily-Anjou and of her family.</p>

<p>The death of Charles II., Duke of Lorraine, on
January 25, 1431, saw the reunion,&mdash;after a century
or more apart,&mdash;of Bar and Lorraine under one
Sovereign. Duke René and his Duchess Isabelle
had resided more or less quietly for ten years at the
Castle of Bar-le-Duc, and there the greater part of
their family was born. Now they prepared to move to
Nancy, but their way, which Duke Charles had, as
he thought, secured, was barred, and René was called
out to fight for his throne. Antoine, Comte de
Vaudémont, Duke Charles’s eldest nephew, thrust the
provisions of the Salic Law in the new Duke’s face,
and drew his sword to enforce his action. Varied
were the fortunes of the civil war, but at the Battle
of Bulgneville Duke René was taken prisoner by
Philippe, Duke of Burgundy, who supported his
kinsman Vaudémont, and was kept in captivity for
nearly three years. In vain Queen Yolande tried
every expedient to set her son free. His captors
required his absolute renunciation of the duchy of
Lorraine, and would accept no compromise. Then
came another crushing blow. Louis III., King of
Sicily, Naples, and Jerusalem, Duke of Anjou, and
Count of Provence, died of fever at Cosenza, the
capital of Calabria, on November 15, 1434, lamen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>ted
alike by friend and foe. Queen Giovanna had in
1424 created him Duke of Calabria, but many
attributed his death, indeed, to poison administered
by order of the Queen. Never was there a more
gentle nor a braver Prince&mdash;“<i>l’escarboucle de gentilesse</i>,”
he was styled in the annals of chivalry. His
devoted mother, of course, was not with him; she
was broken-hearted at Marseilles. Cast down by
grief unspeakable, the young Queen of Sicily-Anjou
and Naples, Margherita, still a bride, was by his side
to console his last hours. They had been married by
proxy at Geneva,&mdash;not at Chambéry, as arranged,&mdash;years
before, but had sworn to each other recently in
the Cathedral of Cosenza. Alas! no son was left to
succeed his father and cheer his mother’s heart; their
only child, a little daughter, had survived her birth a
short six weeks.</p>

<p>Queen Giovanna, in spite of her iniquity in seeking
to foist upon René d’Anjou and Bar a child not his
nor hers, in all probability, but so acknowledged,
made no opposition to his proclamation as King of
Naples or the Two Sicilies. What an exquisite piece
of irony it was, to be sure&mdash;a King proclaimed
when fast bound in prison, a crayon for a sceptre in
his hand, his crown a drab <i>berretta</i>! Three devoted
women, good and bad, supported the royal captive’s
prerogatives&mdash;three Queens indeed: Yolande was for
Anjou and Provence, Isabelle for Barrois and
Lorraine, and Giovanna for Naples and Sicily; whilst
a fourth, Queen Margherita, looked to the donjon of
Dijon for clemency. It was said that a copy of King
René’s proclamation was fixed upon the portal of his
prison in insolent derision. “<i>Sic transit gloria mundi</i>”
might well have been penned beneath it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon King René’s succession to the throne of
Sicily-Anjou, Queen Yolande continued to act as his
Lieutenant-General for Anjou and Provence, and left
negotiations for his release to the young Queen-Duchess
Isabelle, who was very much more favourably
placed, and near at hand to serve the royal
prisoner’s interests. She spent most of her time in
Anjou, but paid many visits to Marseilles, her
favourite residence in Provence. She never crossed
the Aragonese frontier; she could have done so only
as Queen-regnant, which of course was impossible.
However, she named her grandson Jean, Duke of
Calabria, King René’s eldest son, as the heir to her
ancestral claims.</p>

<p>The Queen-mother’s presence in Anjou was necessary
in the interests of her daughter, Queen Marie of
France, and she never relaxed her control of the
policy of her royal son-in-law. At each accouchement
of the French Queen her devoted mother
assisted, and it was a long family of grandchildren she
nursed upon her knee. Her succour in sickness, her
stay in trouble, and her help in poverty, were immeasurably
precious to the fugitive Sovereigns. In
1437 Queen Yolande had the felicity also of receiving
her son René, after his release from durance vile, in
the Castle of Tine, near Saumur, and with him came
Queen Isabelle and her children,&mdash;Prince Jean, the
eldest, being a fine lad of eleven. It was a season of
universal rejoicing in Anjou, and the Queen-mother,
laying aside her widow’s <i>chapelle</i> and veil, entered
whole-heartedly into the festivities. The most cheering
feature of the gaiety was due to the magnanimity
of the Duke of Burgundy, who quite unexpectedly
and unreservedly offered the crown of peace by proposi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>ng
that Princess Marie, daughter of Charles I.,
Duke of Bourbon, his niece, should be affianced to the
young Duke of Calabria. The ceremony of betrothal
was duly celebrated in Angers Cathedral, the little
bride being no more than seven years old. This was
a great joy to the Queen-mother, and René and
Isabelle were very happy, too.</p>

<p>Again in 1440 the splendours of the Angevine
Court were once more revived by the Queen-mother,
when she welcomed right royally King Charles VII.
and Queen Marie. It was by way of being a family
gathering also, for King René and Queen Isabelle
were of the party. It was a reunion remarkable in
one way, as the introduction at Angers of the most
lovely girl in France, in the suite of Queen Isabelle,&mdash;a
girl destined to play a very important part in the
private life of King Charles VII.,&mdash;Agnes Sorel.
The Queen-mother was charmed with her lovely
young visitor, and never made any opposition to her
appointment as Maid of Honour to Queen Marie.
These festivities, however, were the last in which
Queen Yolande took part. The sorrows she was
called upon to bear and the anxieties of the life she
lived had their natural effect even upon such an
ardent and vigorous constitution as hers. Gradually
she retired altogether from public life, and in 1441
she took up her residence at Saumur. The castle was
one of the strongest fortresses in France, and was one
of the very few which held out successfully all through
the Hundred Years’ War. Originally called <i>La
Tour du Tronc</i>, Count Foulques Nerra, Count of
Anjou, in the tenth century gave it the appearance
and stability which it subsequently retained. Queen
Yolande placed her suite within the castle precincts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
but she herself, putting on an oblate’s habit, occupied
for some time a house in the Faubourg des Ponts,
where her privacy could be less easily disturbed.
What remains,&mdash;and that, alas! is very little, of this
habitation,&mdash;is still called <i>La Maison de la Reine
Cicile</i> (Sicily). In this humble abode Yolanda
d’Arragona, “the great Queen,” died quietly on
December 14, 1443.</p>

<p>Whether King René was present to close his
beloved mother’s eyes we know not, but it is significant
of absence that the expense,&mdash;500 livres,&mdash;of
the Queen’s obsequies was borne by her youngest
son, Charles, Duke of Maine; indeed, it is almost certain
that René was at Marseilles when he heard of his
mother’s death. In one of his “<i>Livres des Heures</i>”
he inscribed: “<i>Le 14 Decembre de l’an 1443 trespassa
au Château de Saumur Madame Yolande,
fille de Roy d’Aragon et depuis mère de Roy René</i>.”
The funeral ceremonies were celebrated by the Archbishop
of Tours, her private chaplain, not at Saumur,
but at Angers, in the Cathedral of St. Maurice, to
which her remains were conveyed by night two days
after her death. Her grave was that of her consort’s,
twenty-five years before,&mdash;in front of the high-altar,&mdash;but
all trace of it has disappeared, and explorations
have failed to reveal her burial casket.</p>

<p>It is eloquent of the irony of human affairs, that
whereas no memorial, or even inscription, is left to
record the virtues of the royal mother of Anjou, in
the Church of Nôtre Dame de Nantilly at Saumur
there is a memorial to Mère Théophaine la Magine,
the devoted nurse of King René and Queen Marie,
who died March 13, 1458. The original monument,
erected by the King, presented his faithful domestic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
holding him and Marie in her arms. This has been
destroyed, but an epitaph still remains:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Cy gist la nourrice Théophaine</div>
<div class="verse">La Magine, qui ot grant paine</div>
<div class="verse">A nourrie de let en enfance</div>
<div class="verse">Marie d’Anjou, Royne de France,</div>
<div class="verse">Et après, son frère René, Duc d’Anjou.”</div>
<div class="english">
<div class="verse">“Here lies good nurse Théophaine</div>
<div class="verse">La Magine, who at great pain</div>
<div class="verse">Foster-mother’d in infancy</div>
<div class="verse">Marie d’Anjou, Queen of France,</div>
<div class="verse">And then René, Duke of Anjou.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The only existent memorials to King Louis II. and
Queen Yolande are to be seen in a stained-glass
window in the Cathedral of St. Julien at Le Mans,
the capital of Maine, one of the richest and most
beautiful specimens of fifteenth-century glass in
Europe. The royal couple are upon their knees,
attired in conventional costumes, and bare-headed.
Their youngest son, Charles of Anjou and Maine, is
buried near that splendid window, an interesting and
curious circumstance in the happenings of Providence.
He died in 1474. All Anjou and Provence bewailed
their Queen, her virtues, her benevolence, her piety,
her loyalty.</p>

<p>Yolande’s claim to the title with which she has
been honoured, “a good mother and a great Queen,”
needs no vindication. She was, in short, the most
noble woman in all France during the first half of the
fifteenth century.</p>

<span class="smaller">ISABELLE DE LORRAINE&mdash;“THE PRIDE OF LORRAINE”</span></h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Child-marriage was a distinguishing mark of the
Renaissance, but its fashion in the Sovereign States
of France was very much more commendable than its
prototype in Italy. In the Italian republics it
became a holocaust of immature maidens, condemned
to untimely death through the perverted passions of
worn-out men of middle age. In France the girl
brides were mated with boy husbands, but cohabitation
was regulated by the watch and will of guardians.
In both countries, doubtless, the marriage contract
was essentially a commercial undertaking, but in
France it marked the attainment of political and
dynastic aims. Sovereign families rarely allied their
offspring out of the ruling class. At the same
time the danger of conjugal union between individuals
nearly related was immeasurably increased.
Indeed, such relationships were those most zealously
cultivated by ambitious and exclusive rulers. The
marriage of René d’Anjou and Isabelle de Lorraine
was a striking and typical instance of this precocious
marital custom.</p>

</div>

<p>Isabelle, “the Pride of Lorraine,”&mdash;as she was
acclaimed by her devoted subjects at the time of her
betrothal,&mdash;was born at the Castle of Nancy,
March 20, 1410. Her parents were Charles II.,
Duke of Lorraine, and his consort, Margaret of
Bavaria. Charles himself was the eldest son of Jehan,
Duke and Count of Lorraine, and Sophie, Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>ss of
Würtemberg. Born in 1364, at Toul,&mdash;a free city
of the German Empire and an ecclesiastical sovereign
see,&mdash;Charles succeeded his father in 1392.
Originally a fief of the Holy Roman Empire,
Lorraine was erected a kingdom by the Emperor
Lothair, who styled himself “King and Baron of
Lothairland.” The first Prince to bear the ducal
title was Adelebert, in 979, and that style descended
unbroken through 500 years.</p>

<p>The Duchess Margaret was the second daughter of
the Emperor Robert III., Duke and Baron of Bavaria.
She married Charles II. in 1393. To them were
born eight children, but, alas! Louis and Rodolphe
died in infancy, Charles and Ferri before their
majority, and Robert in 1419, unmarried, at twenty-two.
Of their three daughters, Isabelle was the
eldest. Marie became the wife of Enguerrand de
Coucy, Baron of Champagne and Lord of Soissons,
a lineal descendant of the founder, in the thirteenth
century, of the famous Château de Coucy, the most
complete feudal fortress ever built, whose proud
motto may still be seen on the donjon wall:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Roi je ne suis</div>
<div class="verse">Prince ni Comte aussi:</div>
<div class="verse">Je suis le Sire de Coucy.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This union was childless. Catherine, the third
daughter, in 1426 married James, Marquis of
Baden, Count Palatine of the Rhine and Elector.
She renounced all claims to Lorraine. Their only
child was a daughter.</p>

<p>At the time of their marriage, Charles II. of
Lorraine and Margaret of Bavaria were a mod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>el
couple upon the principles of dissimilarity and contrast.
The Duke, a soldier born, had made good his degree
of knighthood ten years before, when, a mere stripling,
he won his spurs fighting daringly by the side of
his cousin, Philippe “le Hardi,” Duke of Burgundy.
With him he went on a punitive expedition against
the pirates of the Barbary coast. At Rosebach,
and especially at the tremendous battle of Azincourt,
he did prodigies of valour. In Flanders and in
Germany his ensign led on victorious troops.
Charles’s last military achievement was the rout
of the Emperor Wenceslas under the very walls of
Nancy. No warrior loved fighting more than the
Duke of Lorraine. Slightly to alter the text, he
was one of those war-lords whom Shakespeare, in
his “seven ages of man,” says “sought reputation
at the cannon’s mouth.” He yearned for the
applause of gallant knights, both friends and foes;
he yielded himself amorously to the smiles and
embraces of the fair sex, and he revelled in the
praise and adulation of poets and minstrels. His
mailed fist was ever toying with his trusty sword
and grappling the chafing-reins of his charger; his
mailed foot was ever ready for the stirrup and to
trample upon the head of a fallen foe.</p>

<p>At the same time he was a gay and polished
courtier, one of the most accomplished Princes in
Europe. Fond of literature and poetry, he studied
daily his Latin copy of the “Commentaries of
Julius Cæsar” and similar treatises. He had besides
a taste for music, and was no mean exponent of the
lute and guitar, and a friend of troubadours.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the gentle, lovable Duchess
was born for the cloister and for the worshi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>p of the
Mass. Her bare feet were ever moving in penitential
pilgrimages and religious processions, and her shapely
hands were ever joined in prayer or divided in
charity. Her passion was the submissive rule of
Christ, her will the conquest of herself.</p>

<p>Daring and devotion thus harnessed together
rocked the family cradle, and insured for their offspring
the best of two worlds. Such a union was
bound to be productive of genius and corrective of
faults of heredity. What a bitter disappointment,
then, it must have been for both the Duke and the
Duchess when one after another their beauteous
babes and adolescent sons dropped like blighted
rosebuds from their young love’s rosebush prematurely
into the cold, dark grave, leaving only the
aroma of their sweet young lives to soothe their
sorrowing parents!</p>

<p>Isabelle was the fairest daughter of the three.
She inherited the force of character of her father
and the pious disposition of her mother, and to these
precious traits she joined a spirit of intelligence much
in advance of her years as a growing girl. In short,
she was remarkable “<i>pour ses qualités de l’esprit et
du cœur</i>,” a description difficult to render into good
English; perhaps we may say she had her father’s
will and her mother’s love.</p>

<p>Many were the suitors for her hand, some for the
pure love of beauty, grace, and spirit, but most with
a view to the Duke-consortship in the future of rich
Lorraine. The “Pride of Lorraine,” indeed, served
as an ever-reinforced magnet. She became remarkable
for her loveliness of person, her animation of
manner, and her distinguished carriage. The natural
sweetness of her voice lent a gracious persuasiveness
to her eloquence, which in later life proved invalua<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>ble
in the recruiting of adherents to her husband’s cause.
High-souled and condescending, she brought her
enemies to her feet, only to raise them her warmest
friends. Talented beyond the average of Princesses,
she had also the charm of winsome gaiety, and proved
herself a worthy spouse and companion for her gallant
and clever consort René. Tall, slim, fair-haired,
blue-eyed, with a skin of satin softness, the “Pride
of Lorraine” won all hearts and turned many a head.</p>

<p>To Louis, Cardinal de Bar, was due the accomplishment
of an idea suggested by Queen Yolande
with respect to the future of her second son, René
d’Anjou. He had for ever so long been considering
what steps he should take with respect to the succession
to the duchy. He of course, as an ecclesiastic,
could have no legitimate offspring. His brothers had
died childless, and only one of his sisters had male
descendants, the grandsons of Violante de Bar, his
own grand-nephews. In His Eminence’s mind, too,
was a project to reconstitute the ancient kingdom of
Lothair by merging Barrois and Lorraine proper.
Whilst Duke Charles II.’s young sons were living,
the Cardinal looked to one of them as his heir; and
when they all drooped and died, he reflected whether
or not he should name Charles as his successor. At
this juncture his niece, the Queen of Sicily-Anjou,
was busy looking out for brides for her two elder
sons, Louis and René. For the former a Bretagne
alliance was indicated; for the latter a union with
Lorraine&mdash;Burgundy for the time being out of the
question&mdash;or Champagne seemed desirable.</p>

<p>The Cardinal clinched the matter, and paid a visit
to the Duke of Lorraine in furtherance of his p<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>roject,
which was the very natural and sensible one of
marrying his nephew René with the Duke’s eldest
daughter Isabelle. Whether Charles had any inklings
of the Cardinal’s cogitations with relation to his
own position with respect to Bar we know not; but
possibly he had, for he met the proposition with a
direct refusal. He read to his relative two clauses of
a will he had recently executed, which forbade his
daughter Isabelle to marry a Prince of French origin,
and especially barred the House of Anjou. This
latter prohibition was inserted with reference to the
rupture between Jean “sans Peur,” the Duke of
Burgundy, and Louis II., King of Sicily and Duke
of Anjou, which resulted from the part the former
had played in the assassination of the Duke of
Orléans in 1407, and the consequent repudiation of
the betrothal of Catherine de Bourgogne and Louis
d’Anjou. Lorraine and Burgundy were in close
alliance.</p>

<p>The Cardinal, however, was not to be diverted
from the course he had taken. He placed ten considerations
before the Duke and his advisers:&mdash;(1) The
advisability of reuniting the two portions of Lorraine;
(2) Charles’s lack of male heirs; (3) his own incompetence
in the same direction; (4) his choice of his
grand-nephew, René d’Anjou, as his successor at Bar-le-Duc;
(5) the attractive personality, mental attainments,
and high courage of the young Prince; (6) his
descent from a Barrois-Lorraine Princess, Violante,
his sister; (7) the risks of the application of the
power of the Salic Law over his daughters; (8) the
equality of age of René and Isabelle; (9) the wish of
the late King and of the Queen of Sicily-Anjou for
an alliance with Lorraine and a better understanding
politically; (10) the welfare of the peoples of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
two duchies and the love of the Lorrainers for their
princely house.</p>

<p>Charles asked time to consider these points, but
meanwhile he summoned the Estates, and laid before
them a proposition concerning the succession to Lorraine
at his death. He named his eldest daughter as
Hereditary Duchess, and proposed that her consort
should bear the title, and with her exercise the prerogatives,
of Duke of Lorraine. A concordat was
agreed to whereby the Estates were pledged to support
the Duchess Isabelle, and to carry out Charles’s
wishes.</p>

<p>Queen Yolande had seconded her uncle’s negotiations
in a very womanly and sensible way. She
communicated directly with good Duchess Margaret.
She pointed out to her the mutual advantages of the
marriage of the two children, and declared that such
a union would heal the breach between the eastern
and the western Sovereigns of France. Margaret,
loving peace and holy things, was easily persuaded to
reason with her husband; she submitted absolutely
to the overpowering personality of the Queen. With
Charles, Yolande had a stiffer fight, but she gathered
up her strength, and in the end, lusty warrior that he
was, he yielded up his defence to the tactful diplomacy
of the good mother of Anjou. Woman’s wit once
more, as it generally does, triumphed over man’s
obstinacy.</p>

<p>Charles agreed to receive the young Prince, and
judge for himself of his prepositions and qualifications.
The result was beyond the Cardinal’s expectation, for
the Duke declared himself charmed with the boy.
He was, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> said, ready to rescind the prohibitory
clauses of his will, but he made it a condition that he
should have the personal and unrestricted guardianship
of the boy until he reached the age of fifteen.
He desired René to proceed at once to Angers to
obtain Queen Yolande’s consent to the matrimonial
contract between himself and Princess Isabelle.
Everything went merrily, like the marriage-bells
which soon enough pealed forth all over Lorraine,
Barrois, and Anjou, at the auspicious nuptials. The
final arrangements were completed, and René and
Isabelle were betrothed at the Castle of St. Mihiel,
and on October 20, 1420, married at the Cathedral
of Nancy by the Bishop of Toul, Henri de Ville,
Duke Charles’s cousin. Immediately before the
wedding, Cardinal-Duke Louis caused a herald to
proclaim publicly, in the market-place of Nancy, René
d’Anjou, Comte de Guise, Hereditary Duke of Bar,
with the <i>ad interim</i> title of Marquis of Pont-à-Mousson.</p>

<p>The record of the marriage is thus entered in
“<i>Les Chroniques de Lorraine</i>”: “<i>Les nopces furent
faictes en grant triomphe, et la dicte fille menée à
Bar moult honorablement. Le Cardinal fust moult
joyeulx.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_4" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> The contract had been signed on March
20, 1420, by the Duke and the Cardinal at the Château
de Tourg, near Toul, Queen Yolande’s signature
being provided by her proxy. She granted to her
son the right to quarter the arms of Bar and Lorraine
with those of Anjou and Guise.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_4" id="Footnote_A_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_4"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> “The nuptials were celebrated with great ceremony, and the
said Princess was conducted to Bar very honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>ably. The Cardinal
was full of joy.”</p>

</div>

<p>On November 10 formal proclamation was made
in every important town in Lorraine, to the effect
that Duke Charles II. constituted his eldest daughter,
now Duchess of Barrois and Countess of Guise,
heiress to the duchy of Lorraine, and confirmed to
her, and to her issue by René d’Anjou and Bar, full
rights of succession and government. The proclamation
named Queen Yolande of Sicily-Anjou,
Louis, Cardinal de Bar, and the Duke himself,
Charles’s guardians during the minority of the young
couple.</p>

<p>“René,” wrote a chronicler, “is well-grown, well-bred,
and well-looking. He is greatly admired by
all the fair sex, and loves them in return. He will
make a good husband, and has the making of a great
Sovereign.” The bride’s praises were sung by poets
and minstrels the length and breadth of Lorraine
and Bar.</p>

<p>Among the earliest to congratulate the young
people and their parents was the redoubtable Duke
of Burgundy! He sent a special embassy to Nancy
with this striking message: “<i>Tous estoient si joyeulx
de veoir la fervente et cordiale amour qui estoit entre
ces deulx jeuns gens, que je me trouve capable des
sentiments les plus amiables pour tous mes cousins
royales. Je salue mes bons frères les Souverains Ducs
de Lorraine et Barrois avec Madame la Duchesse
Marguerite, et sans autre choses la bonne Rogne de
Cecile, son épous le Roy Louis, pour jamais.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_A_5" id="FNanchor_A_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_5" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_5" id="Footnote_A_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_5"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> “Everybody was delighted to behold the fervent and cordial
love which exists between the two young people, whilst I found
myself filled with the most amiable sentiments for all my royal
cousins. I salute my good brothers the Sovereign Dukes of
Lorraine and Barrois, and also the Duchess Margaret, and equally
the good Queen of Sicily and her consort King Louis.”</p>

</div>

<p>This was as a jewel in the hair of Queen Yolande,
and as nectar in the cup of Cardinal Louis. Their
plans had succeeded splendidly.</p>

<p>Shortly after his marriage, René returned to Bar-le-Du<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>c
with his child-bride, and they were received
in royal state by the Cardinal, who had renovated
and decorated the castle specially in their honour and
for their use. The town of Ligny was causing trouble
in Barrois by refusing to pay the accustomed tribute.
The Prince de Ligny claimed that portion of the
duchy of Bar as his, by the marriage contract of his
wife, the Cardinal’s sister. He attacked the Castle
of Pierrepoint and the town of Briey, whose garrison
he caused to be put to the sword. The Cardinal
took arms, and, accompanied by René and companies
of Lorraine soldiers from Longwy, defeated his
relative and took him prisoner. The young Prince
received the rebel’s sword and personally conducted
him to Nancy, where, after two years’ confinement
in the fortress, he signed an act of renunciation of his
pretensions in Barrois.</p>

<p>René, only twelve years old, the following year
accompanied Charles II. of Lorraine to the siege
of Toul,&mdash;for many years a turbulent element in his
dominions,&mdash;where there was a hot dispute concerning
certain laws and customs oppositive to the claims
of the crown of Lorraine. Toul was captured, and
mulcted in an annual tribute of a thousand livres.</p>

<p>Directly the proclamation of Isabelle of Lorraine
with René as the sharer of her throne was made,
Antoine de Vaudémont, Duke Charles’s eldest
nephew, entered a protest and claimed the succession.
He based his action upon the three conditions&mdash;(1)
The Salic Law ruled the succession of Lorraine;
(2) the male line had not been broken since the
creation of the duchy; and (3) the realm had ne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>ver
gone out of the family. Charles scouted all these
positions, affirmed his own sovereign right to name
his successor, and refused to alter the terms of the
proclamation so far as regarded the succession of his
daughter and Duke René.</p>

<p>All the church-bells in Barrois and Lorraine were
again set jingling joyously when, in the ducal castle
of Toul, on the morning of January 17, 1437, a
young mother,&mdash;very young indeed, barely seventeen,&mdash;brought
forth her first-born&mdash;a beauteous boy, the
image, as the midwives said, of the boy-father, not
yet nineteen. Church-bells, too, rang merrily all
over Anjou and Provence when the glad tidings
reached their borders that a male heir was born
to the honours of Sicily-Anjou-Provence. Perhaps
René and Isabelle were too young to realize what
it all meant for France at large, but Queen Yolande
understood well enough its tenor, and with her
congratulations she greeted her first son’s grandchild
with the title of “Prince of Gerona,” linking him
ostentatiously with her hereditary rights in Aragon.
Duke Charles, too, and Duchess Margaret were the
happiest of grandparents, and baby Jean was created
Comte de Nancy as future Duke.</p>

<p>Charles’s death was somewhat sudden and quite
unexpected. Strong man that he was, King Death
seemed to be a power not immediately to be feared.
René was not at Nancy when the death-knell
sounded, but news swiftly reached him, and he returned
at once to the capital. Duchess Margaret,&mdash;despite
her lamentations and her natural dislike to
public appearance,&mdash;attired herself in full Court dress,
the crown she rarely wore upon her head, and all the
officials of the Court, the Government, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>d city, in
her retinue, and hastened to the gate to welcome the
new Duke of Lorraine. Before her carriage rode
a number of lords and knights, who dismounted on
the approach of René, and, saluting him deferentially,
greeted him as “<i>Vous estoit le nostre duc!</i>” The
cry was taken up by all the gallant company, whilst
René, having dismounted at the portal of St. George,
took the sacred missal offered by the Dean into his
hands, and swore then and there to respect and safeguard
the ancient liberties of the State and city.</p>

<p>One of the quaintest of quaint observances followed,
a custom peculiar to Lorraine. After receiving
the ecclesiastical blessing, the new Duke
remounted his horse, and into his hand was placed the
ancient altar cross called “Polluyon.” He rode
slowly through the city to St. Nicholas Gate, where
he again dismounted, and gave his charger into the
care of one of the canons, who took his place in the
saddle and rode out of sight. This strange custom
had been observed at all the public recognitions of
new Dukes of Lorraine ever since its inception by
Duke Raoul, in 1339. The Duke then returned on
foot to St. George’s, bearing still the jewelled cross.
At the entrance the Bishop stood ready to administer
the customary oaths and to accord the Papal benediction.
This ceremony also was unique. The
Bishop told him to face the assembly of his subjects
at the four points of the compass, and to repeat at
each the formula: “I take this oath before God and
you willingly, and look to God for assistance, and
to you for service.”</p>

<p>Then conducted to the castle in great circumstance,
amid the vociferous plaudits of the populace,&mdash;“<i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>Noël!
Noël!</i>” they cried,&mdash;the Duke knelt and
kissed the hand of Duchess Isabelle, who was waiting
there, and presented her to the delirious citizens.
“<i>Vive le nostre Duc! Vive la nostre Duchesse!</i>” rang
through the city, and, caught up by the sculptured
pinnacles and turrets of the cathedral, mingled
harmoniously with the musical cadences of the bells,
and so was wafted over all that fair and smiling land.</p>

<p>René, although but two-and-twenty, gave immediate
evidence of wisdom beyond his years. His
power to grasp and handle complex affairs of State,
and his discrimination in matters of moment, proved
the excellence of his grand-uncle’s training. His
personal appearance was all in his favour, and his
graceful, well-set-up figure, his open countenance, his
majestic manner,&mdash;ever ready to bend to circumstances,&mdash;gained
general admiration and confidence.
His gracious, patient, and conciliatory bearing was
remarkable. His modesty and absolute lack of
presumption attracted the best men of all parties.
His readiness to appoint a Council of State, with
unusual freedom of deliberation and action, was only,
perhaps, what might have been looked for from the
son of the founder of the free Parliament of Provence
in 1415. The new Duke set on foot movements for
the amelioration of the condition of the poor, for the
improvement of education, and for the rectification
of the morals of the Court and city. One of his
earliest edicts was for the suppression of blasphemy;
a first charge was punishable by the judge in the
ordinary way, a second involved a heavy fine, a
third obtained correction in the public pillory, and
a fourth offence was purged only by the splitting
of the tongue and rigorous imprisonment.</p>

</div>

<p>In all these, and many similar acts of sapient
policy, Duchess Isabelle bore her part in counsel and
example; her conduct was beyond all praise. The
next move was a progress through every part of the
two duchies. At each considerable town the royal
cortège halted first of all that the Duke and Duchess
might make their devotions in the principal church,
and endow Masses and ecclesiastical grants. Then,
assembling the officials and chief citizens, they
inquired into the hardships of the people and
encouraged local institutions, at each place leaving
largesse for distribution. In strong places with
garrisons, the Duke interested himself in redressing
injuries and inequalities among the veterans.
He offered to pay all the losses of officers in the
wars; he allowed eighteen sols for each horse killed
in battle or on march; he bestowed on each soldier
a surcoat and steel helmet with his royal cognizance,
and created many knights. Meanwhile Duchess
Isabelle endeared herself to the women-folk by consoling
words of sympathy and gracious doles of
charity. Widows and orphans she took under her
personal patronage, and no worthy claimant for her
benevolence lacked favour and assistance.</p>

<p>Thus René and Isabelle won, not only golden
opinions, but the sincerest affection of their subjects,
rich and poor. But a climax was put to the
noble works of the kindly Sovereigns, and never came
truer the saying; “Providence ever destroys the
good that men do.” An evil genius appeared upon
the peaceful scene when Antoine de Vaudémont
refused to pay allegiance to the new Duke and
Duchess. The moment of his declaration of hostility
was as unfortunate as it was cruel. At the public
baptism of Prince Jean, the Duke’s eldest son, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>who
had been privately baptized at his birth, in 1426-27,
the Count entered the Cathedral of Nancy in full
armour, and objected to the Duke of Calabria,&mdash;the
title of the young boy,&mdash;being received by the
Church as heir to the throne of Lorraine.</p>

<p>The Duke immediately summoned him to appear
before the Council of State, and also before a
meeting of principal citizens, and there repeat his
protest. By both assembles his pretensions were
scouted unanimously. Sieur Jehan d’Haussonville,
the Mayor, addressed the Count, and said: “Your
uncle has left daughters; the eldest, Isabelle, is
Duchess of Lorraine. I salute you. You may go.”
Vaudémont left Nancy in a violent rage, crying out
as he passed through the gateway of St. George:
“I shall be Duke of Lorraine all the same, and
soon, and then will I reckon with you dogs!” He
posted off to Dijon, and there took counsel with the
Duke of Burgundy.</p>

<p>The body of Charles II. had scarcely been consigned
to its monumental tomb in the choir of St.
Georges de Port at Nancy, when the Comte de
Vaudémont revealed himself in his true colours.
After his protest against the edict of the Duke
which named Duke René of Barrois, the consort of
the heiress to the throne, as his successor to the
title of Duke of Lorraine, he had remained skulking
in his castle, where he welcomed as many malcontents
and disturbers of the peace as accepted his pretensions
to the crown. The coronation of Duchess
Isabelle was the signal for Vaudémont’s attempt to
vindicate his claim. He had hardly a sympathizer
at Court, for Charles had caused all the principal
nobles and citizens to swear allegiance to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
daughter and her husband before he died. The
Count appeared suddenly before Nancy, and demanded
the keys and the custody of the Duchess. Duke
René was away besieging Metz, but he at once
posted off to Nancy, and assisted with men-at-arms
by Charles VII., and aided by the generalship of
Barbazan, he defeated Vaudémont in eight battles
great and small.</p>

<p>Vaudémont rallied his forces from Burgundy under
Antoine de Toulongeon, Duke Philippe’s favourite
general, and enlisted foreign mercenaries from
Flanders and Germany. René had at his back all
the armed men of Lorraine and Bar, and contingents
from Anjou and Provence. James, Marquis of
Baden, and Louis of Bavaria, joined him with
squadrons of cavalry, and his army numbered
nearly 20,000 men. Perhaps he was over-confident
of his strength, his right, and his intrepidity;
and having a very much more numerous
following, he advanced upon his enemy disregarding
sundry cautions and wise counsels. The two armies
met upon the plain of Bulgneville, near Neufchâteau,
on July 2. Vaudémont played a waiting game;
besides, he had in reserve heavier artillery than his
royal foeman. Early in the encounter Barbazan
fell mortally wounded, and then René himself received
a wound which incapacitated him for a time. The
fall of their leaders demoralized the Lorraine army,
and Vaudémont, seeing his advantage, made a dash
with a column of heavy cavalry. René was smitten
to the ground and surrounded. He refused to
surrender until an officer of sufficient rank should
be allowed to receive his sword. Then Toulongeon
galloped up, and the Duke, covered with blood and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
dust, was lead away to the Burgundian camp.</p>

<p>Taken the same evening to the Château de Talant,
near Dijon, the royal prisoner was treated with the
deference due to his rank, but, alas! he had fallen
into the hands of the enemy of his house&mdash;the
hated Duke of Burgundy. That evening the curfew
sounded not in Nancy, but the gates were shut
and barred, and two weeping women, powerless in
their woe, never sought their couches in the castle.
Mother and daughter, Margaret and Isabelle, were
nigh death themselves. No tidings could they gain
of the whereabouts or of the condition of the man
they loved. Duchess Isabelle cried out: “Alas! I
do not know whether my husband is dead or alive
or wounded, nor where they have taken him.” None
had a consoling answer, for all Nancy was in mourning.
Two thousand good men and true lay dead
upon the stricken field, and three thousand more
shared the imprisonment of their Duke. The wounded
in hundreds crawled into city, village, and mansion;
not a house in Lorraine but was flooded with women’s
tears and men’s blood that desperate day and night.
At last splashed and bedraggled heralds brought
news of the Duke’s captivity, and that his wounds
were not serious: “<i>M’sieur le Duc, madame, estoit
en bon santé; les Bourguignons l’avoient pris: il se
trouv at Dijon demain</i>.”</p>

<p>Thus assured of her husband’s safety, Isabelle
brushed away her tears and roused herself to action.
Promptly she called together the Council of State,
where she presided in person, and eloquently demanded
that strong measures should at once be taken to carry
on the war against Vaudémont and Philippe de
Bourgogne, raise sufficient funds to make good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> losses,
and secure the liberty of the Duke. The Council
responded nobly and patriotically to the call of their
Duchess; as the “<i>Chroniques de Lorraine</i>” has it:
“They had pity upon her, for she had borne four
sturdy children as comely as you might wish to see.”
“<i>Elle fust allegrée!</i>” was the universal testimony to
Isabelle’s worth as a wife and mother. Duchess
Margaret, too, perhaps for the first time in her life
of devotion, raised her voice, and called for the
temporal sword to be reground to avenge the disaster.
She accompanied her daughter, both mounted, to
Vézelise, which Isabelle had appointed as the rendezvous
of the new army, and personally enrolled companies
and squadrons, fastening to each man’s helm
a thistle&mdash;the cognizance of Lorraine. Then she
addressed a protest to the victor of Bulgneville, in
which she warned him not to approach Nancy, but
to regard herself as his implacable foe until he
should deliver up the Duke. Étienne Pasquier, the
chronicler, sums up in ten words the courageous
character of Duchess Isabelle. “Within the body of
a woman,” he says, “the Duchess carries the heart
of a man.” After warning Vaudémont, she concluded
with him a truce of three months, during which
period she went in person to Charles VII., who was
then in Dauphiné, and implored his intervention and
assistance. In her train was a young Maid of Honour,
Agnes Sorel, whose beauty and <i>naïveté</i> rightly
affected that unstable monarch; it was an introduction
which ripened later on into something more
intimate than mere admiration.</p>

<p>Duchess Margaret also greatly bestirred herself.
Hearing that her uncle, the Duke of Savoy, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
brother-in-law, the Duke of Berry, were at Lyons
awaiting the coming of King Charles, she posted off
there, taking with her as advisers the Bishops of Toul
and Metz. In company with the King of France
was no less a person than Queen Yolande, his
mother-in-law&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">as we read in the “<i>Heures de Charles VII.</i>”</p>

<p>René was not kept long at Talant, but transferred
to the fortress of Bracon, near Salines. His imprisonment
varied in severity; at times he was treated
roughly, half starved and unclothed, with no resources
or intercourse with friends outside. Then he was
served with dignity befitting his rank, and granted
facilities for the better occupation of his time. But
what a staggering blow was his misfortune to all his
dreams and aims of honour, glory, and sovereignty!</p>

<p>Lorraine was in a terrible state, and so was
Barrois; men knew not what to do nor whom to
trust. Overrun with soldiers of fortune and the riff-raff
of foreign camp-followers, security for person and
for property was no more. Vaudémont made, however,
no use of his victory&mdash;at least, so far as pressing
his claims to the duchy. Everywhere his cause was
unpopular; indeed, he found himself in the very
unusual and humiliating position of a victor denied
the fruits of his victory. He disbanded his army
and retired from Lorraine, and took up his abode
with his ally, Philippe of Burgundy, and there awaited
developments. René found means to communicate
with his desolated wife, and forwarded instruct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>ions to
the Estates of Lorraine and Barrois to acknowledge
and serve Duchess Isabelle as Lieutenant-General
during his captivity. She entered upon her responsible
duties with the utmost fortitude and courage.
All historians testify to her indefatigable zeal and
administrative ability.</p>

<p>Whilst the two Duchesses were doing all they
could to effect the Duke’s release and maintain the
rights of Lorraine and Barrois, René himself made
a direct appeal to Philippe of Burgundy, and on
March 1, 1432, he proposed certain terms to his
royal gaoler. They were as follows: (1) The acceptance
by the Duke of Burgundy of Duke René’s two
young sons, Jean and Louis, as hostages for their
father; (2) the cession of the castles of Clermont
en Argonne, Châtille, Bourmont, and Charmes; and
(3) the payment of the Burgundian troops in full for
all arrears. Philippe accepted these hard conditions,
and added to their harshness by fixing a ransom
of 20,000 <i>saluts d’or</i>. At the same time thirty
nobles of Lorraine and Barrois offered themselves
in lieu of the two young Princes.</p>

<p>This contract Philippe submitted to the Comte de
Vaudémont for his approval, which he gave after
much consideration, but required the insertion of a
clause to the effect that his son Ferri should be
betrothed to Yolande, Duke René’s eldest daughter,
then not quite three years old, and that she should
receive a dowry of 18,000 <i>florins de Rhin</i> for
the purchase of an estate in Lorraine, and he
added very cunningly a proviso that residuary rights
to the duchy should be settled upon the issue of the
marriage. This was with grim vengeance the hoisting
both of the Duke and the Count upon their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
petards. Such an extraordinary arrangement was,
perhaps, never before contrived by the craft of man.</p>

<p>At Nancy in the Queen’s apartments there was
sorrow keen. Isabelle’s heart was stabbed to the
core. Could she part with her dear children? That
was the question she had to answer. The other
clauses of René’s charter of freedom were serious
enough, to be sure, but none of them weighed upon
a mother’s heart as did this. As she looked out
upon the pleasaunce whence came echoes of childish
laughter, her will failed her. No, there they were,
Jean and Louis, lovely boys of six and four, too
tender much to leave her fostering care, too young to
face the rigours of captivity. And yet her dearly
loved husband, René, could not be left in durance
vile; his liberty was of the first importance, and no
sacrifice would be too great to bring him home to her
again. What should she do? First of all she knelt
in prayer to God, and implored the aid of St. Mary
and the saints. St. George was for Lorraine. Then
she hied her to the boudoir of her mother, Duchess
Margaret, and fell upon her bosom, sobbing violently,
the woman with the courage of a man! Those tears,
however, washed away her momentary want of
resolution, and when she had laid bare her troubles
before her sympathetic parent, the answer to her
prayers came through the same devoted channel.</p>

<p>“Isabelle, my child,” the old Duchess said, “dry
your tears, and thank God in any case, for this trouble
will pass. St. Mary, the Mother of Jesus, feels for
you, the mother of her boys. She inspires me, too,
and I am ready to take the dear children myself to
Dijon or wherever our René may be, and to remain
with them till Philippe of Burgundy plays the ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>n
and the Christian and releases them, and then our René
shall fold thee to his heart ere many suns have set.”</p>

<p>This pious and heroic resolution of the good-living
Duchess-Dowager was, perhaps, no more than Isabelle
expected. She, of course, could not take her hand
off the helm of State, but her mother was a <i>persona
grata</i> at the Burgundian Court; at least, she had been
so when she came as a bride to Nancy many years
before. The long and the short of the matter was
that Duke René was released from his prison on
March 1, 1432. He gave his parole to return there
within a twelvemonth if the conditions of his freedom
were not complied with.</p>

<p>By a curious concatenation of circumstances the
arrival of Duchess Margaret and her two little grandsons
at Dijon synchronized with that of the Duke of
Burgundy. He had been away in Flanders and in
the English camp on political business, and had postponed
the bestowal of rewards and honours upon his
adherents at Bulgneville. Now he called a Chapter
of the “Order of the Toison d’Or” at Bracon, of all
places in the duchy, apparently forgetful of the fact
that his royal prisoner was there. The fortress
possessed two towers; in one of these René was
confined,&mdash;henceforward known as <i>La Tour de Bar</i>.
There were three floors; on the topmost were the
Duke’s two chambers, below certain Lorraine prisoners
of distinction were accommodated, and the guard
occupied the ground-floor. The other tower contained
the regalia and the archives of the Order. A
very pleasant story is told of a meeting of the two
Dukes at Tour de Bar, and it delightfully illustrates
the French proverb, “<i>Noblesse oblige</i>.” On the day
of the Chapter the Duke of Burgundy, passing th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>e
portal of René’s tower, cast up his eyes, and beheld
his prisoner looking out of a window. He tossed up
his bare hand in token of recognition, and sent an
officer up to René’s chamber with a request that
he would permit him to enter and hold converse
there. Such a demand appealed, of course, instantly
to the chivalrous instinct of the Duke of
Lorraine and Bar, and the two Sovereigns clasped
each other’s hand in silence. Philippe’s heart failed
him at the greeting of his captive, and he shed tears.
Whilst the Princes were so engaged, a noble of the
Court of Dijon approached his liege and delivered
him a despatch, the perusal of which greatly affected
him. It was, indeed, the intimation that Duchess
Margaret of Lorraine was in attendance with René’s
two young boys at the palace in Dijon, awaiting
Duke Philippe’s pleasure. He communicated the intelligence
to Duke René, who covered his face with
his hands and sank to his seat in a conflict of emotions.</p>

<p>Duke Philippe, laying his hand on his prisoner’s
shoulder, said: “<i>La parole du Duc du Bar est plus
forte que les ôtages!</i>” Then he added: “Pray,
Monseigneur, consider the portals of the Tour de Bar
open to your orders. Let us go together and greet
the good Duchess Margaret. You and she and your
children shall be set forth this day to Nancy. May
the good God cheer your way!” This was magnanimity
incarnate&mdash;a choice trait of the days of <i>la
vraie chivalrie</i>! To describe the joy of René as he
once more caressed his sons and kissed the hand of
his mother-in-law, and to set forth the rejoicings
at Nancy, and, indeed, all along that joyous march
from Dijon, with the blessedness of reunion between
Isabelle and her spouse, would tax the pen of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>any
ready writer. René was free, and Philippe had
attained his apogee. Joy-bells rang, voices cheered,
and Lorraine and Barrois gave themselves over to
unbridled festivity; whilst the Duke and Duchess and
their two brave boys made a royal progress, whereon
they were nearly torn to pieces by their enthusiastic
subjects. René and Isabelle once more visited every
town, and personally thanked all and sundry for their
loyalty and affection.</p>

<p>But business is business even in royal circles, and
the Estates of Lorraine and Bar were assembled by
the Sovereigns to consider and fulfil the terms of
René’s charter of liberty. The crux was the amount
of the money ransom, and how to raise it. Both
duchies were stripped bare of resources, prolonged
wars had impoverished the nobles, and had brought
upon all classes great privations. In Anjou and
Provence much the same conditions existed, and
Queen Yolande had as much as she could do to make
all ends meet. King Charles VII. was a fugitive
or little better, he had no money, and the Duke of
Brittany had his own responsibilities and cares. The
only wealthy member of the Sicily-Anjou family was
the Queen of Naples, and she was financing King
Louis III. and his conflict with the King of Aragon.
Nevertheless something had to be done, and René
and Isabelle together put their pride into their
pocket and made approaches to their unlovely relative.
Queen Yolande and Duchess Margaret also
backed up the appeal.</p>

<p>René embarked at Marseilles directly Queen
Giovanna’s reply reached him, for she demanded
that his request for assistance should be made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
person at Aversa. It was not a very pleasant prospect
that presented itself to the Duke of Bar-Lorraine.
The ill-fame of the Queen of Naples had
by no means been lessened by her attempted liaison
with his elder brother, King Louis. Nevertheless,
René was prepared to pay a high price for the
20,000 <i>saluts d’or</i>, but Isabelle had no fear for his
honour. The mission was a failure. The Queen’s
price was impossible; and although René remained
in dalliance upon her, and played the part of a complete
courtier, so far as was possible for him to do,
she dismissed her relative with a sneer and a refusal.</p>

<p>News of René’s failure reached Nancy before his
own arrival, and resourceful Duchess Isabelle immediately
set to work upon an alternative plan for
securing the liberty of her consort. The city of
Basel was then preparing to receive the Fathers of
the Ecumenical Council of the Roman Church, and
with them the citizens were required to welcome
the Emperor of Germany, under whose protection
they were. Sigismund was the son of Marie de
France, sister of Louis I. of Sicily-Anjou. Moreover,
he had married the Princess Elizabeth of Bavaria, a
sister of Duchess Margaret.</p>

<p style="clear: both;">Isabelle despatched a notable embassy to greet
her uncle the Emperor, and at the same time to
crave his sympathy and help. A very favourable
reply came quickly back to Nancy, and with the
returning Lorraine envoys travelled two Chamberlains
of the Imperial Court, sent by the Emperor to
escort René to Basel. Sigismund furthermore cited
the Comte de Vaudémont to appear before him and
state his case. A most patient hearing was granted
by His Majesty to the arguments of the victorious
Count, but on April 24 Sigismund ascended the
imperial throne in the Cathedral of Basel, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>d there
solemnly gave his judgment. He decreed that René
was lawful Duke of Lorraine, that he should not be
required to return to prison, and that further grace
should be allowed for the payment of the ransom.</p>

<p>With scant reverence for the sacred edifice, and
with much discourtesy to the Emperor and the
dignitaries who sat with him as assessors,&mdash;the
Papal Legate and the Patriarch of Constantinople,&mdash;Vaudémont
indignantly refused to accept the imperial
ruling, and demanded the immediate payment of
the 20,000 <i>saluts d’or</i> or the prompt return of
Duke René to Bracon. Duchess Isabelle, who had
courageously accompanied her husband, fell upon her
knees before their stern, irreconcilable enemy, and
pleaded with him to extend knightly magnanimity
towards his prisoner. No! Vaudémont would
have the duchy or René’s money or his person.
René, gently raising his loving spouse, led her from
the scene, and then, tenderly embracing her, he returned
to where he had left Vaudémont scowling.
“See,” said he, “here I am: take me at once to Dijon.”
Before leaving the Imperial Court the Emperor
beckoned to him, and, directing him to kneel, formally
invested him with the temporalities of the duchy
of Lorraine, and upon Isabelle he bestowed with the
Papal benediction the honour of the “Golden Rose.”</p>

<p>Torn from the bosom of his family once more,
René bore his misfortune like a man, and Isabelle
rose superior to her trouble. Their noble bearing
gained further the respect and good-will of all the
Sovereigns and peoples of Europe, whilst the spleen
and meanness of Vaudémont rendered him odious
everywhere. René submitted obediently to the
newly-imposed discipline. He beguiled his time by
adorning the walls and windows of his chamber wit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>h
sketches and paintings. What a thousand pities it
is that none of those treasures have been preserved!
Alas! France has suffered more than any other land
from the suicidal tendencies of her people. Over
and over again national passion has swept away
works of art and historical memorials. King René’s
frescoes have, with the fortress of Bracon, wholly
disappeared. Music, too, and poetry, formed for him
consolations. He composed <i>ballades</i>, he sang songs,
sacred and profane. He played the viol and zither,
and so whiled away some of the tedium of his
captivity. “<i>Les Chroniques de Lorraine</i>,” note that
“<i>il a sçu la musique, et marier la voix aulx doulx
accents d’un luth, gémissant sous ses doigts</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_A_6" id="FNanchor_A_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_6" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_6" id="Footnote_A_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_6"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> “He knew music, and how to modulate his voice to the notes of
a lute, striking it with his fingers.”</p>

</div>

<p>At Bracon was the Duke of Burgundy’s splendid
library, to which René was freely admitted. There he
studied painstakingly classical works in Greek, Latin,
and Hebrew.</p>

<p>Cut off as he was entirely from intercourse with
his family, friends, and subjects, at times he gave
way to melancholy, and regarded himself as unjustly
treated by Providence. He craved to behold his
children, and this longing was assuaged by the
chivalrous consideration of the Duke of Burgundy,
who permitted the little Princes Jean and Louis to
visit their unhappy father in his prison.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The years 1434 and 1435 were full of tragic happenings
for René and Isabelle. Death claimed thre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>e important
personages near of kin. All Lorraine mourned
the saintly Duchess Margaret. She died in her
devoted daughter’s arms during the feast of Pentecost,
and they buried her beside her consort, Charles II.,
in the ducal tomb at St. George-by-the-Gate. Her
quiet influence had been all for good, both upon her
children’s account and upon the morals of the Court
and nation. She could, as we have seen, act the
heroine as well as the devotee. Isabelle missed her
mother’s goodly counsels more than she could express
in words. René’s greatest loss was undoubtedly his
brother, Louis III., King of Sicily-Anjou and Naples.
This bereavement wholly changed the position and
prospects of the Bar-Lorraine ducal family; for Louis
dying without surviving issue, all his honours, titles,
and dominions, were inherited by his next brother, René.</p>

<p>This event, and what it meant for René, were the
climax of his career. The proclamation of the new
King was a tragedy and a travesty combined. The
pathos of his position was emphatic. The news
stunned him&mdash;powerless and wellnigh nerveless, hopeless
and wellnigh demented. He had not regained
his equanimity, when the mockery of his fate was
borne still more cruelly upon him in the intelligence
that reached him on February 2, 1435, in the Tour
de Bar, of the demise of Queen Giovanna II., whose
will named him her successor as King of Naples.</p>

<p>Louis died of fever at Cosenza, the capital of Calabria,
on November 15, 1434, lamented by his enemies
as well as by his friends. His devoted mother was
not with him. She was broken-hearted at the news
which reached her at Angers. Alas that so gallant a
soldier-King should be cut off so suddenly and so
prematurely in the first bloom of his manhood! Cast
down with grief unspeakable and mute, his girl-wife&mdash;still
a bride&mdash;Marguerite, consoled his last hours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
No child had come to bless their union, and the
palpitating passion of the honeymoon was naturally
cooling. The stress, too, of martial movements
separated all too soon and too frequently the bridal
couple. Still, Queen Marguerite ministered tenderly
to her sick spouse, and her love burst forth in undiminished
fervency as she realized that death would
so cruelly part them. Very nobly and unselfishly,
Louis in his will,&mdash;very strangely, made exactly to
the day a year before,&mdash;required all honour to be
paid to his widow, for his sake as well as for her own,
and left her the bulk of his private property&mdash;alas!
greatly diminished by the expenses of his military
campaigns. Moreover, he expressly directed that she
should be free to go where she would,&mdash;if not to
Anjou, then to her home again in Savoy,&mdash;and he
besought her, “for the love she bore him, not to pine
away in sadness, but to choose some good man and
marry him, for the relief of nature and for the love
of God.”</p>

<p>Marguerite buried Louis with the burial of a King,
and built a monument to his memory in the cathedral,
and she directed that the sword of Lancelot, the
British knight whom Louis had unhorsed at tilt and
slain, should be suspended over the royal burying-place.
Then she speeded back to her father’s Court,
not adventuring herself at Naples, where Queen Giovanna
lay a-dying. Good and true wife that she was,
she kept her sorrow silently and unaffectedly for
twelve long years, and then she married another Louis&mdash;Louis
IV., Duke of Bavaria. Short was again
this second union, for after another two years’ widowhood
she married, for a third time, Ulric VII., Count
of Würtemberg, in 1452. At Stuttgart, after s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>o
many tragic changes, Queen-Duchess-Countess Marguerite
settled down, and lived seventeen years in
peace and happiness, drawing her last breath upon
the very day of November, the 15th, which had witnessed
the marriage vows of Louis III. and herself
just thirty-six years before.</p>

<p>Duchess Isabelle de Lorraine, now Queen of Sicily-Anjou
and Naples, with her accustomed promptitude,
despatched a messenger to the King in prison, announcing
her instant departure for Naples. She sapiently
understood that her presence in Italy was essential if
the crown of Naples was to rest securely upon her
husband’s head. She would receive the allegiance of
the Neapolitans in his name, and administer the
government as his Lieutenant-General. On November
28 she left Nancy with her second son, Louis,
Marquis of Pont-à-Mousson, and travelled post-haste
into Provence. Again her presence kindled the most
enthusiastic expressions of commiseration for the lot
of the King and Count, and of devotion to his person
and to herself. Men and money poured in upon her.
She welcomed all, and accepted gratefully everybody’s
contribution.</p>

<p>From Marseilles the Queen and her following
sailed to Genoa, where the Doge and the nobles gave
her a right royal reception, and volunteered help and
amity. Thence to Milan the intrepid traveller took
her way, where she gained over the Duke, and he
made René’s cause his own. In Rome, Pope Eugenius
IV. blessed her and her son, and conjured all
the Italian States to lend their aid. Her arrival at
Naples was so entirely unexpected by the Alfonsists
that they were not only checkmated in their attempt
on King René’s inheritance, but were thrown int<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>o a
panic, from which they were unable to rally.</p>

<p>The Neapolitans of every grade and class welcomed
their new Queen and her five great galleys, filled with
the flower of Provence, Milan, and Genoa, with
every manifestation of joy and loyalty. Her charms
of person transported them, her intrepidity roused
them, and her gracious words delighted them. The
old love of Naples for the House of Anjou returned,
and every adherent of the Spanish King was cast out.
Queen Isabelle had very soon more serious work in
hand than graciously acknowledging the salutations of
the enthusiastic citizens. King Alfonso was at the
gates of Naples with a strong force on land and sea.
She in person assumed command of the loyal troops
in the capital, appointed trusty commanders, and
placed Naples in a good state of defence. Besieged
rigorously by the Spanish army, the Queen directed
sorties which were perfectly successful, and the enemy
retreated to a more respectful distance. In one of
these affrays, Dom Pedro, brother of the King of
Aragon, was slain, and Queen Isabelle, with a spirit
of chivalry worthy of a noble knight and a magnanimous
Sovereign, offered his dead body royal sepulchral
rites in the cathedral.</p>

<p>During Queen Isabelle’s absence from Lorraine,
King René named their eldest son, Jean, now Duke of
Calabria,&mdash;the traditional title of the heir to the
throne of Naples,&mdash;as his Lieutenant-General in
Barrois and Lorraine, child though he was, not yet
ten years old. Nominally he was placed under the
tutelage and guardianship of Queen Yolande, who
made a progress to Nancy to assist in carrying out her
son’s command, and to look after the two little
“orphaned” girls, Yolande and Marguerite, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
granddaughters. Most prudently she abstained, as
might have been expected from her high-toned character,
from interfering in any affairs of State in these
two eastern duchies of her son’s dominions. Four
high officials she selected to direct the policy of the
palace and safeguard the crown, all men of proven
probity and loyal disinterestedness, and to them she,
by René’s wish, delegated the actual charge of the
young Duke: Jehan de Fenestranger, Grand Marshal;
Gerard de Harancourt, Seneschal; Jacques de Harancourt,
Bailli or Mayor of Nancy; and Philippe de
Lenoncourt, tutor to the young Princes.</p>

<p>Queen Yolande having seen all these matters
settled, and having named Anne, Countess of Vaudémont,
<i>governante</i> of the two young Princesses, she
took her departure to Provence and Marseilles, there
to await the course of events in Naples. The appointment
of a Vaudémont must have struck most
people as extraordinary. The Countess was mother
of the implacable Count Antoine, and it was due to
Queen Yolande’s remarkable foresightedness that she
was chosen. She saw the perils ahead caused by the
number and dispersion of the dominions of the crowns
unfortunate King René had not yet put upon his head.
It appeared to her that Naples and Sicily would be
the chief appanage, and require the presence of the
Sovereign almost continuously. Anjou and Provence
might fall to the government of René’s second son,
and then Bar and Lorraine would go to his daughters,
perhaps upon their marriage. Vaudémont would
never relax his efforts to gain Lorraine. Might not a
matrimonial alliance between a son of his and a granddaughter
of her own, thought the Queen, solve
amicably and profitably a very vexed question?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>All the while that Queen Isabelle was holding
Naples for her consort and keeping Alfonso of Aragon
in check, nothing was neglected which might hasten
the release of the royal captive. With commendable
astuteness Isabelle made overtures to her namesake
Isabelle, Duchess of Burgundy, and her efforts were
seconded on the spot by Queen Yolande. Isabelle of
Portugal was in disposition and tastes very much like
the late lamented Duchess of Lorraine&mdash;much affected
by religion, by charity, by pity. The separation of
the King of Sicily-Anjou and Naples from his family,
and the sorrows of his Queen, appealed to her womanly
sympathy. She talked long and well to Duke
Philippe, and at last succeeded in gaining his signature
to a decree of pardon and an order of release for the
distinguished captive. Under her persuasion the
amount of the ransom was halved, and René’s liberty
was unlimited.</p>

<p>King René of Sicily-Anjou and Naples was set free
from durance vile at Bracon on November 25, 1436.
No doubt this achievement was greatly due to the
urgent pressure of all the Sovereigns of France,
headed by King Charles VII.; indeed, the Duke of
Burgundy had hardly any choice in the matter, for
Arthur de Richemont, brother of the Duke of
Brittany and Constable of France, who was the bearer
of the united royal protest, gave him plainly to understand
that the retention of René at Bracon would
mean the immediate invasion and devastation of the
duchy.</p>

<p>René went off at once to Nancy and Bar-le-Duc,
there to be welcomed by his subjects and to thank
personally his many warm friends and helpe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>rs. After
embracing his children, he hurried on to Angers, where
Queen Yolande greeted him tenderly and made him
rest and refresh himself. She had been busy, as was
her wont, in more matrimonial adventures, and now
she broached the subject of the betrothal of the young
Duke of Calabria, her eldest grandson. The bride
she had chosen for him, with Queen Isabelle’s approval,
was the Princess Marie, a daughter of the Duke of
Bourbon, a little motherless girl who had been under
her care for some time. She was a granddaughter
of King John II. the Good, and niece and ward of the
Duke of Burgundy, who dowered her with 50,000
<i>écus d’or</i>.</p>

<p>There was, however, not much time for King René
to waste in festivities. He set off to thank King
Charles, the Duke of Brittany, and all the other
friendly Princes who had so greatly aided his deliverance.
Then he hastened by water,&mdash;the usual method
of quick transit,&mdash;down to his favourite Provence,
where the transports of delight with which he was
welcomed surpassed all former demonstrations. He
wanted men and money,&mdash;and Provence was never
backward in contributions for her Count,&mdash;for his
next move was to be to Naples, to embrace his noble
Queen and relieve her of her heavy responsibilities.</p>

<p>The usual course was taken by the royal galley.
Genoa was the rendezvous, as of old. The Genoese
gave their visitor a splendid reception. His romantic
career had greatly affected them, and now that they
beheld his gracious person their delight knew no
bounds. Never had a royal visitor such an ovation
in Liguria. The famous Tommaso Fregoso, the
Doge, lodged him in the Ducal Palace, the streets
were wreathed in spring greenery, and all the maids
and matrons of the proud city combed out their rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
brown, lustrous locks of hair, jauntily fixed their
white lace veils with jewelled pins, and put on their
best attire and massive chains of gold. At the
entrance of the Piazza di San Lorenzo one hundred of
the fairest of the fair scattered flowers before King
René’s white steed of state, and six of the prettiest
and the noblest were dedicated to his personal wish
and disposition. This indeed was a Scriptural and a
patriarchal custom, but always duly observed in decorous
and sensuous Genoa. But again pleasure had
to give way to business, and King René had the satisfaction
of sailing out of that famous harbour followed
by a goodly flotilla of fighting ships well found.</p>

<p>René was received at Naples tumultuously as
lawful King and Sovereign. Mounted on a great
black charger, crowned and habited in cloth of gold
and covered with the royal mantle of state of crimson
velvet and ermine, the sword of St. Januarius in
his hand, he rode through people, flowers, banners,
and huzzahs, right into the nave of the cathedral;
there Queen Isabelle received her consort exultingly,
and with him knelt lowly for the benediction of the
Mass. That day marked an amazing contrast in the
fortunes of two men&mdash;King René, the prisoner of
Bracon, seated upon the ancient throne of Naples,
and King Alfonso, the conqueror of Aragon, pacing
uneasily his prison chamber at Milan!</p>

<p>The reunion of the royal couple was a happy thing
indeed, so often parted had they been and so sadly.
Isabelle had acted the part of a good woman and a
faithful spouse despite splenetic insinuations to the
contrary. Her position had been most trying in
anxious times, and among ill-disposed aspirants for
her favour. She knew intuitively who to trust of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
those that expressed themselves most devoted to her
service, and no one ever was more zealously preoccupied
with the interest of her friends than she.
Now came the time to award honours to the faithful
and the true, and King René deputed his Queen to
bestow the royal favours. The first to profit by
the new dispensation was, naturally, the widowed
Queen Margaret, who after the burial of her consort,
King Louis III., had sought refuge in Naples, under
the sheltering wing of her royal sister-in-law. Still
resplendent in her beauty and possessed of every
youthful grace, the young Queen was the object
of deep solicitude and affection.</p>

<p>The condition of the Two Sicilies was parlous;
almost every commune was divided against itself on
the subject of the succession to the throne, and
almost daily were recorded deeds of cruelty and
aggression, pointing to the outbreak of serious
hostilities all over the dual kingdom. The blue and
white ensign of Anjou and the red and yellow banner
of Aragon were reared, not in friendly contest, but
in deadly feud. Under these circumstances René
judged it expedient for the Queen and their little
son Louis to go back to France, and Queen Margaret
refused to be separated from her sympathetic sister-in-law.
It was a pang to both again so soon to part,
but rulers of States are not like ordinary mortals;
for public duties must take precedence of private
interests. Isabelle’s brief rule at Naples had done
wonders in the way of conciliation, and Étienne
Pasquier did not exaggerate her virtues when he
wrote: “<i>Cette vraye Amazone, que dans un corps de
femme portoit un cœur d’homme, fist tant d’actes
généraux pendant la prisonment de son mari, que<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
ceste pièce este enchassée en lettres d’or dedans les
annales de Lorraine</i>.” All Naples shed tears at
their beloved Queen’s departure. Margaret they
hardly knew, but the last Queen they had known,
Giovanna, was hated quite as thoroughly as Isabelle
was adored.</p>

<p>The galley bearing back to Marseilles those whom
he most loved had hardly passed beyond the horizon
of the Bay of Naples when René took action. On
September 22 an Anjou herald appeared in the camp
of King Alfonso, and threw down King René’s bloodstained
glove as a challenge, first to a personal
encounter between the two Kings, and then to
a combat <i>à l’outrance</i> between the two armies. On
the part of Alfonso, who was on his way from his
Milan prison, the challenge was accepted by his chief
of the staff, who indicated the locality for the trials
of chivalry and force,&mdash;the level country between Nola
and Arienzo, at the foot of Vesuvius. Single combat
was denied by Alfonso, and then René attacked his
rival with all the forces at his command. Numerically
again, as at the stricken field of Bulgneville, the
Angevine army was much the stronger, for under
René’s banner marched the Milan-Genoese contingent,
with Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan, at its head.
René’s fleet, too, was at anchor in the bay, commanded
by the intrepid Admiral Jehan de Beaufort,
to act in conjunction with the land forces of his King.
The Spanish army was better disciplined and better
furnished with artillery, and King René once more
had to bow to circumstances, and to look in vain for
Fortune’s smile. His forces were cut in two and
slaughtered right and left, and he himself wounded
and all but captured, for he was not a leader to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
skulk behind his men: he led the van, and was ever
in the thick of the fight. His appeal, “<i>Anjou-Cecile!
Amor Chevaliers!</i>” was of no avail. He was beaten,
and fled with only two knights, and shut himself
in Castel Nuovo. A truce was signed, and the
King of Naples went off to report his defeat at
Rome, Florence, and Genoa.</p>

<p>Pope Eugenius IV. and the Emperor Joannes
Paleologos, who were both at Florence, received the
royal fugitive ardently, blessed him, and awarded
him and his heirs, disregarding the victory of King
Alfonso, the right to govern the Two Sicilies in
perpetuity. The Medici and other Florentines of mark
and wealth offered subsidies for the recovery of the
Neapolitan throne, and at Genoa and Milan men and
supplies were to be had for the asking; but René had
had his fill of war, and bloodshed was now to him
abhorrent. “Too much blood,” he remarked, “has
been shed already. We will rest awhile, and ask
God to pardon our sins.” René returned to Marseilles
in 1442 a sadder and a wiser man. There he met
once more his Queen, to rejoice his stricken heart;
but that heart, and hers too, tenderly bled again and
again, for not only did the melancholy news of his
good mother’s death in Anjou shatter him, but
Isabelle and he had the terrible grief of parting with
their dearly-loved second son, the Marquis of Pont-à-Mousson.
Prince Louis, so promising, so handsome,
and so loyal, they buried sadly: he was his mother’s
favourite child, the companion of her triumphs and
her trials.</p>

<p>King René was called from his grief over the
tomb of his young son to Tours by Charle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>s of France.
To the French Court had come Ambassadors, with
the Earl of Suffolk at their head, to treat for peace
between the two conflicting kingdoms. The French
King, with his usual lassitude, deputed to King René
the conduct of the deliberations, which ended honourably
for all parties concerned, in the guarantee of two
years’ cessation of hostilities, with the acknowledgment
of in <i>statu quo</i>. Nearer home, however,
matters were not so stable; the state of the allied
duchies was deplorable. So insecure were the roads
in Lorraine,&mdash;infested by wandering bands of discontented
peasantry and ill-affected townspeople,&mdash;that
travelling was attended with the utmost danger.
The higher the dignity of a wayfarer, the greater the
eagerness to attack and pilfer. Queen Isabelle was
herself the victim of a dastardly outrage. Journeying
forth soon after her dear son Louis’s death, to pray
at his grave at Pont-à-Mousson, her cortège was
attacked by a party of marauders from Metz. They
compelled her to leave her litter, with its cloth of
gold curtains and luxurious cushions, and subjected
her to rough treatment in spite of her protestations.</p>

<p>“You villains!” she cried, “you know perfectly
who I am. How dare you offer this gross insult to
your Sovereign! Begone, and let me pass. You
shall richly pay for your temerity.” Jeers and offensive
remarks greeted this haughty command. They
cared nothing for Isabelle nor her consort; indeed,
they were unrighteous allies of the Count of Vaudémont.
The Duchess was stripped of her jewellery,
her <i>coffrets</i> were rifled, and her servants beaten, and
then the miscreants made off.</p>

<p>The Queen hastily returned to Nancy, and laid the
matter before the Council, demanding satisfaction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
“Unless you, my lords,” she said, “at once make a
strong representation to the Governor of Metz, I will
set off to Anjou, and bring the King back to recompense
the miscreants.” All the chivalry of France
was shocked at this amazing outrage, and King
Charles, with Arthur de Richemont and a strong
force, hurried into Lorraine from Dauphiné, determined
to make an example of the gross behaviour
of the Messins. The city barricaded her gates,
sounded the tocsin, and prepared to resist, if might
be, the united forces of France. The besieged held
out for six months, flinging taunt on taunt against
the King and Queen. At last it fell, and the price
the rebels had to pay was onerous, besides the forfeiture
of all their charters and privileges. A general
amnesty was granted on February 27, 1445, in
Barrois as well as in Lorraine. The Messins
signalized their deliverance by offering to their liege
Lord complete allegiance, together with 25,000 <i>écus
d’or</i> enclosed in a splendid gold and enamelled vase.</p>

<p>René now for the first time in his thirty years of
public service and command found himself in the
possession of that rare blessing, Peace, and he prepared
to celebrate it adequately. Isabelle, too, was
only too thankful for the respite; her sorrows and
anxieties had wellnigh broken her courageous heart.
After she parted with her husband in the Bay of
Naples, she landed at Marseilles, and made all haste
to Angers, too late, indeed, to soothe the last
moments of her noble mother-in-law, but drawn there
by the tranquillity of Anjou. There she gave herself
to the education of her two young daughters, to whom
she was happily reunited&mdash;Marguerite just thirteen,
and Yolande a year younger. René again joined his
spouse, whom he loved so fondly, and in whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
honour he had adopted a new royal motto and cipher,
“<i>Ardent Désir</i>,” below a burning brasier. They gave
themselves up to religious exercises, and led a calm
and retired life&mdash;precious to them both after the
alarums of the past. The world was still very young
for them both&mdash;René no more than thirty-seven, and
Isabelle two years his junior.</p>

<p>The most delightful ingredient in their full cup of
joy was the home-coming of their son and heir, Prince
Jean, Duke of Calabria and Lieutenant-General of
Barrois-Lorraine. During eleven strenuous years he
and his devoted parents had rarely met. He had
zealously, after their brave example, addressed himself
to his public duties, and had won golden opinions
from the loyal subjects of the throne. He was nearing
his majority, and with him came his young wife
Marie, whose marriage had been but lately accomplished.
They were stepping bravely together along
the marital way, which their grandparents and their
parents had traversed, unscathed by scandal and
beloved by all.</p>

<p>Great festivities were organized at Angers, Tarascon,
and Nancy, to celebrate the general peace, and in particular
the betrothal of Princess Marguerite d’Anjou. A
magnificent tournament was held between Razilly and
Chinon in the summer of 1446, which attracted all
the most famous knights in France and beyond the
frontiers and an immense crowd of spectators. One
there was, and she one of the fairest of the fair, came
riding beside her father, one of King René’s dearest
friends, Count Guy de Laval; and the King for the
first time set eyes upon lovely Jehanne, who was
destined to mingle her destiny with his right on to
his dying day. René caused “<i>Le Châtel de Joyeu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>se
Garde</i>” to be built of wood richly adorned with paintings,
tapestries, and garlands, and for forty days jousts
and floral games engaged the attention of the gallant
and beauteous company. A very singular and popular
custom was inaugurated at the King’s suggestion.
Four knights of proved probity crossed their lances
in the roadway beyond the Castle of Chinon. Cavaliers,
accompanied by their ladies fair, were made to
fight their way through and carry safe their sweethearts.
A faint heart lost his lady, a knight unhorsed
his horse, and a victorious competitor his sash
of knighthood, which was immediately tied to the
crupper of his fair one’s palfrey. The King himself
took his place in the “Lists” in black armour; his
mantle was of black velvet sewn with silver lilies of
Anjou, and his well-trained charger was black also.
Queen Isabelle and her ladies occupied a flower-decked
tribune, and with her was poor young Queen
Marguerite and her son’s child-wife, Marie. They
were the Queens of the Tournament, but the damosel
Jehanne de Laval was “Queen of Beauty,” scarce
thirteen years old.</p>

<p>Alas! a deadly “bolt shot out of the blue.” The
Duchess of Calabria had but just risen from childbed;
she was not strong enough to bear the excitement
and the toil of such tumultuous gaiety, and upon the
last day of the tournament she fainted in the royal
tribune, and breathed out her brief life before she
could be borne to couch. Thus into life’s sweetest
joys comes sadly too often the relentless bitterness of
sorrow. Faces which only a few short hours before
were wreathed in smiles were furrowed with the ravages
of grief ere the curfew sounded. The tournament ended
in a “Triumph of the Black Buffaloes.” Happily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
perhaps, the child died too, and both sweet bodies
were consigned to one flower-decked grave in the
chapel garden of the Castle of Saumur,&mdash;“<i>la gentille
et la bien assise</i>,”&mdash;a paradise of fragrant trees and
pleasant prospects.</p>

<p>Dire news, too, reached Angers from Provence.
A winter of unparalleled inclemency was followed by
a famine and a pest, which decimated people and
domestic animals, and wrought havoc with the crops.
René and Isabelle took boat once more for their
southern province, and their “<i>le bon roy</i>,” as he was
now called affectionately by his subjects, laid himself
out to alleviate his people’s sufferings. Taxes were
remitted, the poor fed and clothed, and farms restocked.
“<i>La bonté</i>,” he said, “<i>est la première
grandeur des roys</i>.” People noted the King’s grey
hair&mdash;hair “white less by time than white through
trouble,” as chroniclers have written. Trouble makes
all the world akin: the King and Queen bore their
people’s, and they humbly shared their rulers’ griefs.</p>

<p>The clouds cleared off that sunny land, and birds
once more sang in the meadows, and men and maids
were gay. Then it was Tarascon’s turn to celebrate
the virtues of the Count and Countess of Provence.
A Provençal tournament was a celebration <i>ne plus
ultra</i>, and René made that of 1448 famous and
unique by his institution of the knightly “<i>Ordre du
Croissant</i>.” To be sure, it was established at Angers,
whose warrior-patron, St. Maurice, was honoured as
guardian and exemplar of chivalry, and in whose
cathedral church the banners of the knights were
hung. The King himself drew up the statutes of
the Order. With characteristic and chivalrous
modesty, he named, not himself First Master, but chose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Guy de Laval for that honourable post. Conditions
of membership were dictated by religion, courtesy,
and charity, in harmony; only knights of goodly birth
and unblemished reputation were eligible. They were
enjoined to hear Mass daily and to recite the daily
“Hours.” Fraternal love was to be exemplified in
all dealings with their fellow-men at large. An
impious oath or an indecent jest was never to pass
their lips. Women and children were in a special
sense committed to their care. The poor and ailing
were to engage their best offices. Debts of every sort
and gambling under every guise were absolutely forbidden.
With respect to the fair sex, the code of
rules had in golden letters the following order: “<i>De
ne mesdire des femmes de quelques estats quelles soient
pour chose qui doibue d’advenir</i>.” The knights first
impanelled, having taken their oaths of obedience
and accepted service, departed from Anjou, and made
their rendezvous at the King’s Castle of Tarascon on
August 11. René himself again entered the “Lists,”
but champion honours were carried off by his son-in-law,
Ferri de Vaudémont, and Louis de Beauvais; and
the Queen-Countess Isabelle placed floral crowns upon
their brows, a golden ring upon their right hands, and
received a kiss of homage upon her still smooth and
comely cheek.</p>

<p>Nancy was the scene of the most magnificent
gaieties Lorraine had ever beheld. The espousals of
the Princess Marguerite and King Henry VI. were
solemnized in the ancient Gothic church of St. Martin
at Pont-à-Mousson by Louis d’Harcourt, Bishop of
Toul. The King was represented by the gallant
Earl of Suffolk, one of the most famous Knights in
Europe. The ecclesiastical ceremony was rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
all the more auspicious by the joint nuptials of the
Princess Yolande and Count Ferri de Vaudémont.
All France,&mdash;Sovereigns, ladies, nobles, citizens,&mdash;thronged
around the King and Queen; their congratulations
were, however, restrained until the
actualities of the Vaudémont marriage were revealed.
To marry a dear child to the son of a man’s worst
enemy appeared quixotic at the least, and few called
to mind that strange clause in René’s charter of
release from Bracon. The King was, as Duke
Philippe of Burgundy had styled him, a man of his
word; and if proof were wanted, then the appointment
of the young bridegroom’s mother, the Countess,
as <i>governante</i> of René’s daughters furnished it.
Besides this, the presence of the Count himself at
the marriage of his son exhibited not only the reconciliation
of the two rivals for the throne of Lorraine,
but emphasized the innate chivalry of both. To be
sure, Antoine de Vaudémont was in ill-health, his
fighting days were over, and he was searching for
comfort and absolution before he faced his end; and,
in truth, that end was nearer than he thought, for he
died six months after he had given his blessing to
Ferri and Yolande.</p>

<p>A pretty and characteristic story is told of the
loves of Ferri and Yolande. King René was wishful
that his daughter and future son-in-law should attain
more mature age before the consummation of Count
Antoine’s wishes concerning them. The young
knight, “who was,” wrote Martial, “regarded among
men and youths much as Helen of Troy was among
her companions,”&mdash;a very handsome fellow,&mdash;chafed
at delay, and, emboldened by the vows of his fiancée,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
one dark, windy night he with two trusty comrades
broke into her boudoir, where she, ready for the
signal, awaited her lover. Romeo carried his
Juliet away to Clermont in Argonne, and held
her till her father consented to their marriage. This
story is contained in an old manuscript, the handiwork
of Louis de Grasse, the Sire of Mas.</p>

<p>Splendid fêtes covering eight full days followed
the Church ceremonies. The “Lists” were held in
the Grande Place of Nancy, in the presence of the
right worshipful company, headed by Kings Charles
and René and Queens Isabelle, Marie, and Margaret.
Quaintly Martial d’Auvergne wrote in “<i>Les Vigiles
de Charles VII.</i>”:</p>

<p class="noindent">describes those battle-fields of Cupid’s warfare!</p>

<p>The pageantry of the tournament over, the panoply
of the encampment claimed the knightly company of
Nancy, and a mighty cavalcade&mdash;ladies, too, in litter
and on palfrey&mdash;ambled off serenely to the great wide
plains of Champagne, where René and Charles reviewed
at Châlons-sur-Marne the united armies of all
the crowns. It was a sight which stirred all the
best blood in France, and spoke to her Sovereigns and
her statesmen of a new age, when the artifices of war
should give place to the arts of peace. Alas! when
human things appear to promise peace and joy, there
ever comes over the scene the pall of Providence.
War again broke out between France and England,
but now the French held their own and more; and
King René, revived in military ardour, led the
victorious vanguard, and crowned his bays of triumph
by new palms of peace.</p>

<p>Sad news came to him, however, when in Normandy,
from his ancestral Angers. His devoted and dearly
loved Queen, Isabelle, was laid low with illness.
Stalking fever had crossed the castle moat and fixed
its baneful touch upon the royal <i>châtelaine</i>. Do what
she would,&mdash;and her will to the end was vigorous
enough,&mdash;she could not shake off the deadly visitant.
She felt that her end was approaching unrelentlessly,
and with admirable piety the noble, high-toned
Queen controlled her pains, and patiently prepared
herself to face her last foe with courageous resignation.
Her children were gathered by her bedside&mdash;Jean
and Yolande in person, Marguerite in spirit, and
perhaps Louis, too, from his tomb at Pont-à-Mousson.
Quietly and prayerfully on February 28, 1453, she
passed away to join her babes in Paradise, and
“Black Angers” was plunged in deepest mourning.</p>

<p>The death of a great Queen deeply affects men an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>d
women everywhere. Isabelle’s name, like that of
“good Queen Yolande,” had become a household word
in Europe far and wide. Everywhere tokens of
bereavement were displayed, and King René, the
royal widower, hastening home too late to close his
fond wife’s eyes in death, wrote in his tablets:
“Since the life of my dear, dear wife has been cut
off by death, my heart has lost its love, for she was
the mainspring of my consolations.” In every one
of his “<i>Livres des Heures</i>,” and in other books and
places, the artist in the Sovereign painted and drew
the features and the figure of his Queen.</p>

<p>Their married life,&mdash;chequered as it had been,&mdash;had
been as happy as could be. Devoted to one
another with a rare force of faithfulness which knew
no flaw, René and Isabelle were examples for their
generation. No stone has ever been cast at either
of them. Nine children were born to them: four,
Charles, René, Anne, and Isabelle, died in infancy;
Nicholas, their third son, was a twin with Yolande,
born in 1428; he had the title of Duke of Bar, but
died before his majority. Good Queen Isabelle was
buried in the Cathedral of Angers, where nearly
forty years later René’s bones were laid beside her
ashes, to mingle in the common decay till the last
trump shall sound to wake the dead.</p>

<p>There cannot be a better summing up of her gifts,
her graces and her virtues than in the words of the
sententious life’s motto she herself composed, and
wrote in golden letters upon parchment, and gave to
each of her dear children:</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">JEANNE D’ARC&mdash;“LA PUCELLE,” “LA BLANCHE REINE
DE FRANCE”</span></h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>“Give me Duke René de Barrois, the noble son of
good Queen Yolande, to guide me into France.”
The request was made by a simple village maiden
aged not more than seventeen years, and the personage
she addressed was Charles II., Duke of Lorraine.
It was an extraordinary request; the occasion, too,
was extraordinary.</p>

<p>Born on the Feast of the Epiphany in the year
1412, of worthy peasants, at Domremy, in Alsace,&mdash;Jacques
d’Arc and Isabelle Romée, his wife,&mdash;Jeanne
was the younger of their two daughters; she had
three brothers older than herself. Domremy was a
squalid little hamlet, like many another upon the
Meuse, boasting of the mother-church of the commune&mdash;a
grim old building, but glorified by many
figures of holy saints in its coloured windows. The
nearest village was Maxey, upon the borders of
Lorraine. The villagers were in constant feud&mdash;Domremy
for the King of France and her own Duke
at Nancy, Maxey for the Duke of Burgundy and the
hated English. Sieur Jacques d’Arc and his three
stalwart, hard-working sons were as ready with the
pike as they were handy with the plough. Mère
Isabelle and her two daughters were zealous backers
of their menfolk.</p>

<p>Sieur Jacques was, as peasant farmers went, a man
of substance and well connected. He had saved a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
goodly sum of money, and owned, perhaps, the biggest
flock of sheep in the country-side. Milch cows and
fattening oxen grazed his wide meadows. He was a
man of probity, and had served the ancestral office of
Maire of Domremy for many a year. Mère Isabelle
excelled in stitchery as well as in the rearing of
poultry and the cultivation of her fair garden plot.
When about to be delivered of her youngest child,
she dreamed three times that she should bear a girl,
and that she should become famous in her country’s
history. The narrative goes on to say that many
unusual circumstances attended her child’s nativity:
a fierce thunderstorm shook the dwelling, and
mysterious voices uttered the strange cry: “<i>Aux
secours! aux secours de la France!</i>”</p>

<p>Jeanne, the little daughter, was duly christened by
the curé, and from her mother’s womb she was a
child of dedication&mdash;St. Catherine and St. Margaret
were her spiritual sponsors. Precocious from her
weaning, both in physical growth and mental development,
she grew up a devotee at Mass and shrine.
She sought solitude and silence, and declined to share
her playmates’ games. Other children thought her
odd, and old crones shook their heads and pitied
Sieur Jacques and his worthy spouse. Jeanne’s
favourite resort was a thicket near her parents’ home,&mdash;Le
Bois Chènus it was called,&mdash;an oak-wood grove
where her father’s pigs greedily sought for acorns.
The Bois had, however, a weird repute; it had been,
centuries before, a sacrificial site of heathen worship,
and the village folk avoided it at night, for they said
they saw strange figures under the trees and heard
strange sounds,&mdash;in fact, the wood was haunted.</p>

<p class="captionright"><i>To face page 144</i></p>

</div>

<p>One summer’s day in July, 1424, Jeanne d’Arc
was seated, as was her wont, upon an ancient fallen
menhir at the verge of the coppice. She was shelling
peas, and she also had her knitting by her. The
hour of the day was nearly that of the “Angelus,”
when the frightened damsel heard an unusual rustling
of the oaken branches overhead, and somewhere out
of the tree or out of the sky voices sounded faintly
upon her ear. At the same time a strange lurid
light gleamed between her and the church-tower
across the meadow. Laying aside her occupation,
she listened breathlessly, almost in a trance, to what
the “Voices” said; they were pitched in soothing
female treble accents.</p>

<p>“<i>Jeanne soit bonne et sage enfant</i>,” said one; and
another went on: “<i>Va souvent à l’église</i>.” Surely
the heavenly speakers were Jeanne’s holy guardians,
St. Catherine and St. Margaret. Jeanne was
riveted to the spot, and moved not till the twilight
brought her sister looking for her. Jeanne said
nothing, but for seven days in succession she sat
as at the first, and heard the same solemn words
repeated; then on the seventh,&mdash;it was Saturday,&mdash;another
wonder appeared to her: a very glorious holy
one and a watcher,&mdash;the great St. Michael, God’s
warring archangel, in shining armour,&mdash;stood before
her under the great oak-tree, and bade her give heed
to what he said. He told her eloquently and convincingly
the story of the sad state of France&mdash;devoured
by enemies, torn by factions, her King a
fugitive uncrowned. When the heavenly visitant
had finished his impassioned narrative, he bade
Jeanne kneel, and, touching her shoulder with his
flashing sword, said: “<i>Jeanne va toy aux secours du
roy de France</i>.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<p>The girl swooned as soon as her ghostly visitor
had vanished, and so was found, and borne to her
couch by her brothers in alarm. In delirium for days
and nights, she kept on repeating what the archangel
had said, until, amid broken-hearted sobs, her grieving
parents counted her as mad. All the gossips of the
village and those from more distant homes shook
their heads sadly, and said more fervently their <i>Ave
Marias</i>. Jeanne was not mad, and after she had
recovered her usual demeanour she related to her
doubting father and mother and the good curé her
mysterious story. The good priest proposed to exorcise
the evil spirit which he was convinced was in her.
Her father,&mdash;a matter-of-fact sort of man, and
serious-minded, like all the peasant-folk of France,&mdash;thought
a good thrashing was her deserts; her
mother sided with her: she remembered the strange
cry at her Jeanne’s birth. Jeanne heard all they
had to say, and kept silence, her protestations only
adding fuel to the fire of denunciation. She resumed
her usual avocations, but daily sat to hear the
“Voices,” as she called her ghostly visitants, and
daily they repeated their strange instructions. She
spent much time upon her knees in the church, and
at last the curé, good man, gave heed to her infatuation.
“If this be from God,” he said to himself,
“no man may stay her.” He wondered, naturally,
how this quiet and devout village girl could ever be
the Divine instrument for the deliverance of France.</p>

<p>Jeanne’s simplicity and sincerity, her earnestness
and good behaviour, however, gradually silenced unfriendly
critics; and although most folk regarded her
as mad, many believed her story and watched
developments. The strange revelation of the maid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of Domremy travelled far and wide, and brought
many a neighbour and many a stranger to question
her. Among the rest came Sieur Durand Laxaert,
her mother’s uncle by marriage&mdash;a man of means, too,
and well known the country round. He questioned
Jeanne, he questioned her parents, he questioned the
village curé, and then he went off and told the
amazing story to his friend, Chevalier Robert de
Baudricourt, the Captain of Vaucouleurs, a market-town
in Champagne, not far from Domremy. The
gallant Captain listened attentively, but when the
story was completed he burst out laughing. “Why,
man,” said he, “you and all of them are crazy! Just
go back and box the child’s ears soundly; that’s the
way to treat this sort of nonsense.”</p>

<p>The matter dropped so far as the Chevalier was
concerned, but again, in the following January, Sieur
Laxaert approached Baudricourt, and asked him to
see his young niece. He consented, and Jeanne,
wearing her coarse red homespun kirtle and heavy
wooden shoes and her village girl’s coif, was introduced
to the unbelieving Captain. He was dumbfounded
by her appearance, for the lass was no village
hoyden. Her figure was slender, her features refined;
her great brown eyes,&mdash;staring into his face,&mdash;told
only of simple faith and untarnished honour. Her
voice was low and sweet, and there was a something
eerie and incomprehensible about her which struck
the good man, and made him feel uncomfortable.
When he asked her what she wanted, she promptly
replied: “I want to be led to the King of France.”</p>

<p>“My child,” de Baudricourt replied, “that I
cannot do; but, if you wish, I will willingly take you
to Nancy, and lead you to the Duke, your sover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>eign
lord and mine. Prepare yourself at once for the
journey.”</p>

<p>Amid the tears and protests of her parents and
her friends Jeanne started, as she was, upon her
eventful pilgrimage. At St. Nicholas de Pont,&mdash;a
little town two leagues from Nancy,&mdash;she asked to be
allowed to spend three hours in devotions in the
church. When she reappeared, her face was wet with
tears, and her long brown hair hung dishevelled over
her shoulders. She did not seem to care. Her gaze
was heavenward, and the only words she uttered
were: “<i>En avant!</i>” With Sieur Laxaert was a
comrade, a young man, Jehan de Novelonpont, better
known as Jehan de Metz, of good birth and knightly
carriage. He offered Jeanne his sword. She touched
the hilt, and, smiling sadly, said: “Alas! young sir,
that blade will be required erelong to slay thy
country’s foes and God’s.” Thus they entered the
capital of Lorraine.</p>

<p>Duke Charles received his strange visitor somewhat
reluctantly. He was a man of shrewd common-sense,
intolerant of superstition, and impatient of
feminine assumptions&mdash;as his consort, Duchess
Marguerite, learnt to her undoing. He asked curtly
about her home and her occult powers, and jokingly
invoked her aid in the cure of gout, to which he was
martyr, and from which he was then suffering
acutely. “This,” said he, “shall be the test of your
pretensions to save France. Remove my pain, and
I will take you to the King.” Jeanne shed tears,
and, straightening out her rough woolsey skirt, she
looked sadly up to heaven. At last she spoke:
“Take me not, noble Duke, for a common jongleuse.
First of all, noble Duke, I implore you to become
reconciled to the Duchess, your wife; as for me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>, I
am the unworthy instrument of God to set King
Charles of France upon his throne and to scatter his
enemies.” The Duke dismissed the maid with a
wave of his hand. “Take her away,” he said; “be
kind to her; maybe I will see her again shortly.”
“Jeanne,” he added, “in a day or two you shall tell
your tale before some noble lords.”</p>

<p>All over Lorraine and Barrois internecine war was
rife; noble rose against noble, and yeoman and
peasant joined the fray. The most serious was the
rivalry of René, the young Duke of Bar, and
Antoine, Count of Vaudémont, concerning the rights
of succession to the dukedom of Lorraine. Metz,
into which de Vaudémont had thrown himself, was
invested by the Barrois troops, splendidly led by the
boy-warrior&mdash;he was but twenty years of age. A
messenger from Charles requested a truce, and invited
both commanders to join him at Nancy to take
counsel with their peers upon the strange claims of
a shepherd-girl from Domremy. With Duke René
rode a score of knights and nobles; Count Antoine
was accompanied by a like company. Upon the morrow
of their arrival at the capital, Duke Charles
assembled them and others in the great courtyard
of the castle, and sent for Jeanne, who, still attired
in her peasant garb, knelt at his feet and kissed his
hand. Then she surveyed the assembly furtively, as
though prepared for insult or worse, and quietly
repeated her strange story amid general scoffs and
impatience. One noble knight alone gave serious
heed,&mdash;René, Duke of Bar. Duke Charles taunted
her with her inability to mount a horse, much more
to lead an army.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>
<p>“Jeanne,” said he, “thou hast never bestridden a
charger, thou canst not bear a lance!”</p>

<p>“Sire,” she replied, “mount me, and see if I
cannot both ride and hold my own.”</p>

<p>A quiet palfrey,&mdash;the property of Duchess
Marguerite,&mdash;was led into the courtyard by its
groom, but Jeanne refused to mount. “Give me,”
she demanded, “the charger of that Prince yonder,”
pointing to René of Sicily-Anjou and Bar. The
Prince lifted her into the saddle, and his gentleness,
reverence, and good looks, differentiated him from the
rest of that knightly assemblage.</p>

<p>“What is thy name, brave Prince?” she asked.</p>

<p>“René de Bar,” he said.</p>

<p>“What!” the Maid replied, “the noble Duke of
Bar, the gallant son of good Queen Yolande of Anjou.
You shall be my escort into France.”</p>

<p>With that she laid firm hold of the heavy lance,
offered by a young esquire, placed it correctly in
stay, and smartly gathered up the reins. Saluting
Dukes Charles and René, she drove the heels of her
wooden shoes into the horse’s sides, and dashed round
and round the courtyard, the lance in position, and
then out into the open. Astonishment marked each
noble countenance, and then loud applause greeted
this quite unexpected display; it enlisted to her
cause most of the spectators, who had meant to cry
down the girl’s ineptitude, but now were perfectly
ready to follow her. With difficulty Jeanne reined
in her mount, and slowly cantered into the courtyard
again. Saluting in correct knightly fashion the
Duke, her Sovereign, and beckoning René once more
to her side, she dismounted with his help, rendered
up her lance, and fell at Charles’s feet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>
<p>The Duke gently raised the palpitating, girlish
form, and aloud exclaimed: “May God grant the
accomplishment of thy desires! I see thou hast both
courage and intelligence.” Jeanne then turned to
René, and, laying her trembling hand upon his arm,
looked up innocently but intently with her great
brown eyes, into his open, truthful face, and said:
“You, my Prince, will help me, I am sure. There is
none other here in whom I know I can put my whole
trust. You are like the blessed Michael who speaks
to me and strengthens me. You are a Christian
knight; you will lead me into France.” The Maid’s
partiality for René de Bar gave rise, unworthily, to
evil gossip with respect to their mutual relations.
She was attracted to him by the tales of the country-side.
Domremy was so near to the scenes of his
military achievements in Lorraine that news of him
and his prowess affected greatly the younger folk.
The fact that he was the husband of their Princess
Isabelle, “the Pride of Lorraine,” greatly added to
his local fame.</p>

<p>The noble company at the castle moved into the
hall of audience, and there Jeanne laid before them
fully all her loyal aims&mdash;heaven-directed, as she said.
She told them, too, the story of the “Voices,” and
craved their assistance in her enterprise. “We will
traverse France together,” she exclaimed, “until we
find King Charles. We will crown him at Reims,
and we will then cast out our country’s enemies.
Saints Michael, Catherine, and Margaret, will protect
us and our homes!”</p>

<p>This amazing speech by a young country girl
roused general enthusiasm, and the mysterious magic
of her voice and manner disarmed all opposition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Each belted knight drew forth his steely blade, and,
tossing it on high, swore to be her henchman.
“<i>Vive la nostre Royne! à bas les Anglois!</i>” they cried
aloud together. These acclamations hurtled stridently
through gallery, way-ward, and postern, and away
they flew in increased volume past the portcullis, till
every citizen in Nancy and the labourers in the fields
around joined in the ecstatic chorus: “<i>Vive la nostre
Royne Jeanne!</i>” Rich and poor, noble and simple,
and the children, too, pressed into the castle precincts
to catch a sight of the humble yet brave messenger
of God, and perchance to touch her person or her
dress, seeking infection from the virtue and valour
which possessed her. Jeanne’s reception and recognition
at Nancy Castle attained the proportions of
a Bretagne <i>pardon</i>. Church-bells clanged for her,
priests blessed her, and relics of saints were exposed
with the Blessed Sacrament on her behalf.</p>

</div>

<p>Duke René, on his part, showed no hesitation in
accepting the high honour the inspired Maid had
paid him. He kissed her hand, a peasant’s hand,&mdash;strange
act for a royal knight!&mdash;smitten with the
girl’s piety and devotion; he, too, was religiously
affected. Jeanne became an heroic figure in his
estimation. What clean-minded lad is there, or has
ever been, who is not marvellously affected by a
handsome, dashing girl, irrespective of her rank in
life? What traces some have seen of a tenderer
passion still than youthful admiration were surely
hard to diagnose in that first burst of emotional
romance: it may have bloomed later, but René’s
heart was in the safe-keeping of Isabelle. Times
and manners then lent colour to the insinuation,
possibly, for love and lovers were freer then than
now from social conventions. René departed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Bar-le-Duc, to prepare for the expedition. He gave
immediate orders to raise the siege of three fortresses,
Metz, Vézelise, and Vaudémont, and, calling off the
troops encamped there, he returned quickly to Nancy,
to escort Jeanne to the King of France. He found
her arrayed in quasi-armour, with spurs on her mailed
boots; her head alone was uncovered, save for the
glory of her abundant hair. She wore a sash of
white silk, the gift of Duchess Marguerite; her
horse, too, had white silken favours. The cavalcade
started from the castle, René and Jeanne riding
side by side in front. Through byways they went,&mdash;an
ever-increasing host of armed men and camp-followers,&mdash;avoiding
notice as best they could,
marching by night, resting by day, to avoid the
scattered bands of English foemen.</p>

<p>The pilgrimage,&mdash;for such it really was,&mdash;partook
not only of a religious and a warlike character,&mdash;for
Jeanne insisted on attending Mass <i>en route</i>, and
prevailed upon her escort to say their daily prayers,&mdash;but
it exhibited elements of gaiety; with Duke
René rode a company of minstrels, with Jehan
Durant of Bar as their leader. To him René paid
30 gold florins a month&mdash;“to make warlike melody
for keeping up my men’s brave hearts,” he said.
At Troyes, Jeanne and her escort were received
rapturously; the Bishop placed in her hand a white
silken oriflamme, a banner made by ladies of the city,
and censed and blessed her, and so they won their
way to Tours.</p>

<p>Before entering that ancient loyal city,&mdash;under
the special charge of the holy warrior St. Martin,&mdash;Jeanne
requested René to send to the neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
village of Fierbois, and “ask the curé of the Church
of St. Catherine for a sword which hangs,” she said,
“over the high-altar.” It was a famous weapon,
although the doughty knight whose it had been was
unremembered. The blade was of finely tempered
steel, and richly damascened with golden crosses and
silver lilies&mdash;the emblems of Jeanne’s spiritual
sponsors. The sword itself, in size and shape, was
like St. Michael’s own. She told René that the
“Voices” had revealed this relic to her, and had
bidden her hang it on her hip. At Tours, also, René
had news of the whereabouts of the King, who, sad
to say, was a fugitive in and out of his own dominions
and those of his neighbours. Charles VII. was at
Chinon, safe in its majestic castle&mdash;much like that of
Windsor in extent, position, and distinction.</p>

<p>It came certainly as a grievous shock to all that
enthusiastic expedition to find the King,&mdash;“poor as
a church mouse and defenceless as a rabbit,”&mdash;engaged
in frivolities and excesses. The Court at
Chinon was the maddest and the merriest in France.
Duke René, true to his promise, at once sought out
the King, and arranged an interview with the Maid
of Domremy, although His Majesty at first refused
“to be troubled with a country wench.” The meeting
was held in the Grand Logis of the enceinte of
the Château du Milieu. Chinon, indeed, had three
castles connected with one another: The Château de
St. Georges was a sort of advanced fortress, built
by Henri Plantagenet (Henry II. of England) in the
twelfth century, but greatly dilapidated 300 years
later; the Château du Milieu, the most important
part of Chinon, contained the royal apartments; and
the Château de Couldray, the most ancient, dating
from the time of the heroic Thibaut le Tricheur,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
early in the tenth century. Henry II. died in
the Grand Logis, where King Charles VII. had
his temporary residence. In the Salle du Trône,
with its vast chimney-piece of sculptured stone and
its famous painted windows, the King summoned
his courtiers, and, disguised as an ordinary noble of
the Court, he mingled with them, giving out as his
reason that he should “test the wench’s power of
divination. If she picks me out at once, then I will
hear what she has to say; if not, I won’t have anything
to do with her.”</p>

<p>Jeanne was brought into the splendid apartment,
filled with the pageantry of France, and dazzling
enough to have disturbed any ordinary girl’s equanimity.
She made, taught by René, an obeisance
to the empty throne, and then he told her she must
find the King among the company. Without a
moment’s hesitation she went straight up to the
Sovereign incognito, bowed low, and said softly:
“Sire, you are Charles the Dauphin.” Very much
astonished by Jeanne’s appearance and demeanour,
and still more by her certainty as to his identity,
Charles acknowledged himself, and, leading the
unabashed damsel with René aside into the embrasure
of a window, he asked her to give him her
message. This Jeanne did with candour and emphasis,
and furthermore astounded “the Dauphin,”
as she persisted in calling him,&mdash;he had not been
crowned King, of course,&mdash;by “revealing,” as he told
René afterwards, “certain secrets known only to
myself and God.” What these “secrets” were has
puzzled curious inquirers. Probably they concerned
happenings during the King’s youth, and affected the
question of his legitimacy. He, too, was at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
time proposed as the husband of the “Pride of
Lorraine,” the heiress Isabelle. Anyhow, as known
to Jeanne d’Arc, they were the usual exaggerations
of Court and country gossip. Kings, knights, and
ladies, and their doings, ever cause peasants topics
for discussion.</p>

<p>“Gentle Dauphin,” the Maid said, “I am sent to
you to tell you that you shall be crowned at Reims.”
The Court was divided; part held with la Trémouille,
the Chancellor, against Jeanne’s pretensions, some
of the baser sort attempted to make sport of her
rusticity, but the majority sided with Duke René,
who was now more than ever impressed with the
bearing of his “Queen.”</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>All sorts of plans were propounded to test the
virtue and the devotion of the young Domremy
shepherdess. René and those of his following
denounced most of them as indecent and preposterous,
but he allowed two inquiries to be instituted:
one with reference to Jeanne’s orthodoxy in religion,
and the other with respect to her personal chastity.
The King approved both these expedients, and
confided to René,&mdash;youth though he was,&mdash;their
superintendence and execution.</p>

<p>Still acting as Jeanne’s escort, René took her and
a number of Court chaplains, together with the
worthy Curé of Domremy and Sieur Laxaert,&mdash;both of
whom had been sent for from Lorraine,&mdash;to Poitiers,
for examination by a special conclave of Bishops and
theologians. Poitiers was famous for its divinity
schools and its <i>École de Droit</i>, wherein tho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>usands
of students were instructed in doctrinal matters and
subjects of metaphysical science. The Holy See
had there an office of the Congregation of Rites
and a permanent secretariate of hagiology. The
quaint old capital of Poitou was also renowned
for the shrine of St. Radegonde, which attracted
annually vast numbers of pilgrims to kiss <i>Le Pas
de Dieu</i>, Christ’s footprints, where he stood communing
with his gentle servant. Radegonde and
Jeanne had ground for mutual sympathy. Perhaps
Jeanne knew the story of her prototype.</p>

<p>Do what they would, the holy men of Poitiers
could not make Jeanne deviate ever so little from
the thread of her story. “The Voices,” she said,
“speak to me daily, and I feel that my three saints
are with me constantly.” She answered all their
questions fearlessly, and very greatly were they
impressed by her sincerity and amazed at her knowledge
of divinity. No flaw was to be discovered in
her orthodoxy, nor did she yield at all to insinuations
of witchcraft. Indeed, the whole assembly was
affected by her religious enthusiasm, and a careful
précis was preserved of all that transpired during
the examination. This was, in truth, the first step
to the beatification of St. Jeanne d’Arc.</p>

<p>Returning to Chinon, the Maid awaited her
second ordeal&mdash;the inquisition by a panel of matrons.
This delicate business was taken in hand by Queen
Yolande and certain ladies well known for probity
and prudence. Jeanne submitted herself gladly
enough to the “good mother” of her true knight,
René d’Anjou and Bar. They speedily reached a
decision respecting the character of the Maid of
Domremy. Emphatically they repudiated all suggest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>ions
of immorality, and declared that Jeanne
d’Arc was a <i>virgo intacta</i>, “as chaste in mind and
body as the Holy Virgin herself.” “<i>La Pucelle</i>,” as
they styled her, “is,” they affirmed, “a child of God,
the peculiar charge of St. Catherine and St. Margaret,
whose saintly virtues she desires to cultivate. She
is no witch, nor in the pay of any evil-minded persons.
She is directly inspired by God, and St. Michael
is her protector.”</p>

<p>This testimony Queen Yolande delivered personally
to King Charles, and persuaded him to see the
Maid once more and converse more fully with her.
The result of this intercourse was amazing: Charles
became another man. The persuasions of his faithful
and devout consort, Queen Marie, had completely
failed to rouse him, and the exhortations of Queen
Yolande had no more than excited his curiosity, but
the village maid from Lorraine succeeded in inspiring
the trifling, inept Sovereign with new life and energy.
He sent for René, and named him his lieutenant,
and recommitted “<i>La Pucelle</i>” to his care. With
the young Duke was his trusty friend and Mentor,
Armand Barbazan, one of the most perfect soldiers
and gentlemen in France, the precursor of another
knight “<i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>”&mdash;Bayart.
Together they elaborated a plan of campaign which
would be in obedience to the mysterious “Voices”
of “<i>La Pucelle</i>.” This they submitted to la Trémouille,
Dunois, “le Bâtard,” and La Hire, Charles’s
trusted counsellors. It was the latter, probably, who
uttered that veiled rebuke to the King: “Sire, I
never knew any Prince so happy in his losses as
you!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>
<p>These sapient commanders agreed that the first
move in the new operations was the raising of the
siege of Orléans. The King acquiesced; he, too,
had done his part, for he had, upon his own initiative,
detached the Duke of Burgundy from his alliance
with the English, and had thus very materially
prepared the way to Reims and his coronation.
Jeanne d’Arc was, of course, apprised of this decision,
and she was asked what part she proposed to take.
After a night-long vigil in the grand old church of
St. Maurice, where she held communion with the
“Voices,” she told René that she should be by his
side “as leader of the vanguard.”</p>

<p>The Maid had done very much upon the forced
march from Nancy to Chinon to reform the discipline
and the freedom of the soldiers. She forbade swearing
and the use of strong drink. Gambling of every
kind, and resort to fortune-telling mummers, she
penalized, as well as every other illicit distraction.
She expelled in person <i>les filles de joie</i>&mdash;the gay
women who hung upon the fringe of the army and
demoralized both officers and men. Daily she insisted
upon Mass being celebrated on the field of march,
and moved each man to offer his own orisons upon
his bended knee. Among her immediate attendants
were priests and acolytes&mdash;strange comrades, perhaps,
for Duke René’s minstrels; but, then, the two cults,&mdash;Religion
and Chivalry,&mdash;were ever in intimate
affinity: all-honoured Blessed Mary first, and the
saints of God, and all respected the persons of the
weaker sex around them.</p>

<p>It was a well-found, well-disciplined, and well-led
army that left the sheltering battlements of Chinon
on April 29, 1429&mdash;it was a momentous move.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Some in river barges, some in saddle, some afoot,
traversed the lovely spring-smiling valley of the
Loire. Forest echoes were awakened and church-bells
set chiming in response to holy litanies of
Church and lilting songs of chivalry. Peasants put
lighted candles on the lintels of doors and windows
of their rude hovels; every castle and <i>manoir</i> displayed
their banners and boomed their guns <i>en route</i>.
In the churches the Host was exposed on decorated
altars, and <i>Miserere</i> sung.</p>

<p>Before bidding farewell to King Charles, La
Pucelle,&mdash;fully armed, cap-à-pie, in burnished steel
armour of Zaragoza damascened with gold, wherein
she had been clothed by Queen Yolande’s royal
hands,&mdash;took her place upon the foot-pace of the
high-altar of St. Maurice. She placed her white
oriflamme and her crimson-sheathed sword of Fierbois
upon the sacred stone for episcopal benediction, and
then, dedicating her mission and herself once more
solemnly to the God of battles, assumed her trophy
and her weapon. Led by René, she slowly passed
down the nave of the grand old church, and out by
the great portal, whence, mounting her strong white
charger, she rode off amid enthusiastic plaudits and
many hearty prayers, to put herself at the head of
the French host, and thus awaited the signal to
advance.</p>

<p>What a thrilling scene it must have been!
Nothing in modern warfare could ever equal in
circumstance and emotion that pageant pilgrimage.
It was the last hope of France going forth to
conquer or to die, led by a young shepherd-girl and
a youthful royal knight. La Pucelle’s absolute
reliance on the help of God, her remarkable courage,
and the spell she had cast over the King, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> army,
and his Court, were all rendered more convincing to
the common mind by the magic of her personal
appearance. She was hailed as “<i>Nostre Royne en
blanche!</i>” The bright sun shone upon her resplendent
white armour, and the sharp breeze unfurled
her snow-white banner; her white charger, too,
enhanced the <i>tout ensemble</i>. She rode the most
conspicuous object in that dazzling cavalcade, and no
wonder her followers regarded her as almost supernatural.</p>

<p>At Tours and at Blois “Stations” were made for
absolution, and from the latter place Jeanne caused
René, in her name, to write an ultimatum to the
Duke of Bedford, the English Regent of France and
Generalissimo of the English army. She ordered
him and his co-commanders to cease devastating fair
France, sorely stricken as she was, and to avoid the
clash of arms by retiring before her Heaven-directed
forces. “Thou hast had,” she said, “noble Duke,
thy fill of human bleed. Seek now the Divine
pardon, for nothing shall stay me till I have planted
my banner upon the walls of Orléans. Give back to
me the keys of all the towns you have seized, destroy
no more property, repent and retire.”</p>

<p>Alas for human foresight! human quarrels mar
heroic achievements: la Trémouille, Dunois, and
La Hire were not at one with one another&mdash;each
sought his own; but that being impossible, all three
determined that they would master René, Barbazan,
and Jeanne. La Pucelle had made up her mind
to approach Orléans from the right bank of the
Loire; but her rivals led their troops to the other
side, whence the fortifications could only be reached
by crossing the impregnable bridge or by boat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Jeanne, however, was not to be denied, and she
determined to make an assault at once and at all
costs. Seeing herself misled, she summoned René
once more for council, and Guy de Laval, a young
knight,&mdash;second only to René in devotion to La
Pucelle,&mdash;joined the deliberations. A storming-party
was chosen,&mdash;regardless of the opposition of
the three churlish commanders,&mdash;and Jeanne put
herself at its head without any hesitation. Confidence
and enthusiasm prevailed: Jeanne stood upon
the broken bridge whilst René and Guy hammered
at the portcullis; and thus upon May 8 Orléans
was captured. Among the wounded was the Maid
herself, not severely, to be sure, but the sight of her
blood lent frenzied prowess to her soldiery. With
her escort she rode through the streets crowded with
famished, suffering people, who blessed,&mdash;nay, almost
worshipped,&mdash;her. She halted at the cathedral of
Sainte Croix, and held communion with the “Voices,”
and then she went to rest awhile in the humble abode
of Sieur Jacques Bouchier, an honest citizen attached
to the suite of the Duke of Orléans. René lodged
at the ducal palace.</p>

<p>The English withdrew to Paris, where a truce was
agreed to by Louis, Cardinal de Bar, in the name
of his nephew, Duke René&mdash;a very singular arrangement,
but it was the efficient cause of a general suspension
of hostilities. Charles VII. called a council
of war at Blois, which decided that, as the way was
now absolutely open, La Pucelle should fulfil her
mysterious but triumphant mission by conducting
“the Dauphin” to his coronation.</p>

<p>A great wave of patriotism swept over France.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Men asked one another whether this was not the
prelude to deliverance from 300 years of foreign
aggression, and the first step towards the reformation
of civil disorder. Charles rose to his magnificent
opportunity, and rallied all the French Sovereigns in
a league of peace and stability. Even the implacable
Duke of Burgundy, who hated René de Bar and
Charles de Lorraine irreconcilably, was minded to
join in the general <i>rapprochement</i>. La Pucelle
dictated a letter to him, conjuring him to renounce
his petty jealousies for the love of Christ and
St. Mary, to make his peace complete with King
Charles of France, and to turn his hand against the
common enemy. “Come,” she said, “with us to
Reims, there to cement the good-will of all good men
in France.” The Duke actually made some preparations
for the journey, but at the eleventh hour pride
got the better of his reason, and his hand never
grasped those of his brother Sovereigns nor that
of La Pucelle. Notwithstanding all France was
<i>en route</i> to Reims that July, attracted magnet-like
by the Maid’s white steel mail and oriflamme.</p>

<p>The Cathedral of Reims,&mdash;whose marvellous
“Glory of Mary” over the great western portal
Viollet le Duc called “the most splendid piece of
Gothic architecture in the world,”&mdash;had been the
coronation theatre of all the Kings of France since
Henry I. in 1027; but no such ceremony had
equalled in interest and in grandeur that of July 17,
1429. The summer sun awoke betimes the loyal
citizens and the thousands of strangers within their
gates; the genial morning breeze ruffled out gay
banners and pageant garlands which decorated
lavishly each house and street, and soon the world
and his wife were on foot to the cathedral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>There was certainly very much more than a mere
suspicion of <i>fin bouquet</i> in that fresh morning air;
each worthy had filled his flask with generous <i>vin de
la montaigne</i>, with which to quaff jovially the good
healths of Charles and Jeanne and René, inseparable
in the popular mind. “<i>Le Roy, La Pucelle, et le
preux Cavalier</i>”&mdash;that was the toast.</p>

<p>What a motley crowd it was! Some, too, of the
hated English were there, courageously incognito;
but, then, Reims was quite as cosmopolitan in the
fifteenth century as she is in the twentieth, with her
30,000 Yorkshire and Worcestershire wool-weavers.
Probably, however, no forced Yorkshire rhubarb
found its way then, as now, into the vats of the
vintners!</p>

<p>It was a well-dressed crowd, for St. Frisette,&mdash;one
of the patrons of the city,&mdash;has all along had
her devotees, and no coiffeurs are so famous as those
of her romantic cult. Indeed, her influence in fashion
is for ever memoralized by the costumes and headgear,
correctly chiselled, of the statues of the
cathedral.</p>

<p>Saints, prophets, kings, and queens, in stone, high
up in the galleries of the exterior of the cathedral,
looked down approvingly, or the reverse, upon the
rare show and its spectators. The gargoyles of
Reims were ever famous for their unusual benignity.
They were all animation and sparkled in the sunshine;
merriment became emphatic within the
floriated arches of the buttresses. In each a laughing
angel in stone was exercising her witchery and
adding heavenly hilarity to the general good-humour.
The whole sacred building was <i>en fête</i>; it is still the
merriest building in Christendom; its sculptured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
stones have imbibed the effervescence of rare champagne
for centuries!</p>

<p>Within the sacred building all was solemn and
restrained. Resplendent gem-like glass of the thirteenth
century, skilfully leaded in the clerestory
windows of the nave, produced a chiaroscuro of
scintillating coloured light, wherein the spirits of
the mighty and the beauteous dead were mustering
to take, unseen, their sympathetic parts in the
gorgeous functions of the day. Freshly-worked
tapestries, covering the aisle walls, shared with the
vitreous glories the telling of pageant stories of
religion and romance.</p>

<p>The “<i>Sacré</i>,” or coronation, of King Charles was
an unique ceremonial. Supported upon either hand
by the most distinguished Sovereign Princes of
France,&mdash;Louis III., King of Sicily and Duke of
Anjou, and his brother René, Duke of Barrois and
heir-consort of Lorraine,&mdash;he passed majestically up
the nave under the heavy golden canopy of state.
Another Anjou Prince, Charles, Duke of Maine,
nephew of Louis and René, bore the monarch’s train&mdash;his
cousins all. The Grand Peers, with one
exception, Burgundy, marched alongside in sovereign
dignity and pride. Strange it was that no royal
ladies graced the auspicious sacring. Queen Marie
bore no part; she, indeed, remained at Bourges, and
recited her “Hours” in solitude. Neither Queen
Yolande of Sicily-Anjou nor Duchess Isabelle of Bar-Lorraine
was present, but the place of First Lady
was, for all that, occupied by a “Queen,” <i>the</i> Queen
of the coronation&mdash;“<i>la Royne blanche&mdash;Jeanne</i>.”
Such a “Queen” had never stood beside a Sovereign
kneeling for his crown before the high-altar o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>f
Reims. The fabled fame of saintly Queen Clotilde
paled before the brilliant triumph of plain Jeanne
d’Arc. How she bore herself in this her hour of
miraculous victory, and what part she took in the
stately ceremonial, historians have scantily related,
and painters only imaginatively recorded: no précis
has come down to us, no artist made a sketch upon
the spot.</p>

<p>Immediately after the King and his royal supporters
walked with dignity La Pucelle, in her
flashing white armour. In her right hand she bore,
at the salute, the crimson-sheathed sword of St.
Catherine of Fierbois. Her head was bare, save
for her lustrous locks of hair; but some pious souls
thought they saw a saint’s nimbus around her brow;
it was, perhaps, a ring of sunny halo&mdash;a reflection
from her mail of steel, or a coronal of coloured glories
shot through the stained-glass windows. By the
Maid’s side marched her young and true esquire,
Louis de Contes, bearing unfurled her magic
oriflamme.</p>

<p>It was said that Jeanne had not intended to take
any part in the actual coronation of her Sovereign;
it was quite enough for her that Charles and she
had entered Reims together. She was resting
quietly and prayerfully, communing with her patron
saints, and listening, as was her daily wont, of course,
to the “Voices,” within her modest chamber in the
humble hostelry,&mdash;now the Maison Rouge,&mdash;where
her parents from Domremy had put up, when René
and a Sovereign’s escort clattered up to the door and
commanded in the King’s name the Maid’s presence
within the cathedral. At once she donned her
armour, and, giving René her hand, she walked wit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>h
him across the cathedral place to where the King
was awaiting her.</p>

<p>“The people,” it is recorded, “looked on with
awe and wonder. Thus had actually come to pass
the fantastic vision that floated before the eyes of
the young village girl of Domremy, and had thrilled
all France.” When La Pucelle had taken up her
station on the royal daïs, she grasped her white
silken banner in her right hand, saying to those
around her: “This oriflamme hath shared the
dangers: it has a right to the glories!” That
ensign of victory still towers up aloft in the nave of
Reims Cathedral, above the very spot where Jeanne
stood and Charles was crowned&mdash;an abiding mascot
of faith and chivalry. We may well imagine the
heroine casting her eyes over that splendid temple of
God and its occupants, and resting at last mesmerically
upon the glorified figures of her three
beloved holy ones beaming down upon her from the
choirs of saints in the clerestory windows. St.
Michael, St. Catherine, and St. Margaret, were all
there, and their Master, too, for out and away from
the empyreal realm, and beyond the burning sun
of heaven, for the coronation of Charles VII. of
France at Reims was the apotheosis of Jeanne d’Arc
of Domremy. “The glory of God,” as some said
who saw her, “there transformed the village maid into
a bride of Christ”&mdash;a substantial Queen of Heaven.</p>

<p>Immediately after the anointing, the coronation,
and the other ritual acts, were complete, Jeanne
knelt down before her King, her eyes brimful of
tears, and said softly to him: “Gentle King, now
is fulfilled the pleasure of God. I pray you thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Him humbly with me, and let us thank, too, the
good saints Michael, Catherine, and Margaret, who
have so wonderfully aided us. Now my mission to
you, my King, is fulfilled, I pray you release me,
that I may depart with my parents to my simple
home. One thing only I crave: it is that my
beloved village shall be free for ever from taxation,
and that their land and tenements shall be retained
by my people. Sire, I bid you farewell.”</p>

<p>A few days subsequent to the coronation, Charles
held a council of war at Reims to decide the plan
of operations against the enemies of France, and
he again sent René to the Maid’s lodging to bid her
attend. “You have,” said the King to Jeanne,
“not yet quite fulfilled the task you set yourself.
The English still possess our gates. I need your
presence and your services to rid France of her foes.”
The Maid, sad at heart that more bloodshed had to
deluge the soil of the devastated land, had no choice
but to resume her martial garb, and once more to
mount her war-steed. The council was divided in
opinion: some agreed with la Trémouille, Dunois,
and La Hire, and others sided with René and
Barbazan,&mdash;with them was Jeanne,&mdash;and they prevailed.
An advance in force on Paris was the order
of the day. Upon August 13 René, with Jeanne,
led the vanguard of the King’s forces across the
Marne. At Montpiloir a pitched battle was fought,
wherein Jeanne wrought terror in the breast of
superstitious foemen, and René covered himself with
glory. The pick of the English army, under the
Regent himself, the Duke of Bedford, was worsted,
after knightly encounters of noble champions and
prodigies of valour on both sides had been keenly
scored. Wherever the white oriflamme of La<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Pucelle chanced to be advanced, there was panic;
the English regarded her as a supernatural being
whom no human bravery could withstand. Defeat
became a rout, and ten days after leaving Reims
the victorious French army followed Jeanne and
René into St. Denis and recovered the royal
sepulchres.</p>

</div>

<p>Next to popular and soldierly estimation of the
heroism of La Pucelle, was universal admiration
for the courage and resourcefulness of the young
Duke de Barrois. He with his brother, King Louis
of Sicily, were also the champions of the knightly
“Lists,” although Jeanne had prayed <i>her</i> warrior not
to risk his neck in such encounters. René, indeed,
was the hero, as Jeanne was the heroine, of that
wonderful campaign. Only half the truth was told
of his abilities in that saying of the Maid: “René de
Bar is worth more than a squadron of cavalry!”</p>

<p>During these sanguinary operations two royal
ladies, each in her castle boudoir,&mdash;at Angers and
at Nancy,&mdash;were devoured with anxiety and apprehension:
the mother and the wife of René&mdash;“good”
Queen Yolande and “fair” Duchess Isabelle. Their
part was to watch and pray, for each was exercising
a lieutenant-generalcy for her absent hero. Very well
could they each have donned their coats of mail, like
Jeanne d’Arc, for each was to the manner born; but
the closer ties and dearer of motherhood could not be
renounced. Queen Marie also played nobly the
woman’s part; she had her family cares also, and,
now that her consort was like a lion roused, her tact
and love had much to do to restrain his ardour.
Charles was not a soldier born, nor had he been
trained in military command, so his presence in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
field was fraught with risk and danger; his forte was
in reserve. Whilst Marie grasped the bridle of his
charger, Agnes Sorel loosened the girdle of his mail,
and he quietly reposed at Loches.</p>

<p>La Pucelle now assumed another rôle. By
heavenly advice she had been content to guide the
destiny of Charles; now her “Voices” bade her
command in person the army of France against
the foe. The experienced military leaders, one and
all, were discounted, and on September 8 she took
actual command-in-chief, and opened the attack on
Paris. It was on the waning of that fête-day of the
Virgin that Jeanne, in all her flashing panoply of
war, scaled the first ladder raised against the Port
St. Denis; but, alas! before she could place her
foot upon the battlement her thigh was pierced by
an arrow, and she fell. Shades, too, of night were
falling, and René sounded the retreat, whilst many
a gallant heart trembled more for La Pucelle than
for the temporary check. Helped by Guy de Laval
and Jean de Clermont, as constant as himself, the
young chief of the staff placed tenderly the wounded
Maid upon a sumpter-horse, and himself led her to
the nuns’ quarters at the Chapelle de St. Denis hard
by, and assisted to dress her wound.</p>

<p>René rallied the flower of the French forces, and
many a grizzled warrior and many a beardless recruit
felt the influence of his enthusiasm&mdash;whilst all were
ready to lay down their lives for La Pucelle, and
mingle their blood with hers. A quaint couplet says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“La dit il mante la fière bande</div>
<div class="verse">Que le fier Prince René commande!”</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Paris fell, and Charles came to his own, whilst
René bade farewell to La Pucelle, and hurried off
to Bar-le-Duc, where brave and fair Isabelle was
holding her own and his with difficulty against
unscrupulous and unpatriotic factions. Jeanne felt
the absence of her most trusty ally keenly, and missed
his energetic counsels; but she bravely resumed the
conduct of the war, instructed by her heavenly
patrons. A crisis, however, was approaching&mdash;a
crisis which was momentous in its consequence for
herself. Called to give siege to Compiègne on May 24,
1430, she was taken prisoner, and the hopes of
France were wrecked. Without La Pucelle the
fight was impossible, and René had gone too!</p>

<p>The rest of the story of La Pucelle is, alas!
soon told. What she said to Charles, Duke of
Lorraine, at the outset of her mission might well be
said of her now that she was <i>hors de combat</i>:
“<i>La lutte sera vive, mais j’ai le plan précis pour
triompher!</i>” (The struggle will be fierce, but I have
a plan of certain victory!). It was said that Jeanne
was captured by some archers from Picardy, who
crept unseen between the legs of her escort. By
them handed over to John, Duke of Luxembourg, she
was sold to the English. The <i>Tour de la Pucelle</i>
still marks the spot. Not a hand in France was
raised to rescue the holy maiden. Charles himself,
who owed all to her, seems to have forgotten her
very soon after his return to Loches and to the arms
of his “<i>belle des belles</i>,” Agnes Sorel. René was fighting
for his own in Lorraine and Bar, and could do
nothing for his heroine. La Pucelle was taken
from fortress to fortress, each prison being more
fearsome than the last. She was subjected to insult
and injury, treachery and outrage, and, deserted by
everyone, she remained reliant only upon God. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
trial as an enemy and a sorceress was a mockery;
even her own people turned against her; her straightforward
answers and her superhuman fortitude baffled
her judges. At last she was condemned and shut up
in a cage of iron, her feet fettered with irons, and her
body stripped almost to nakedness. Alas that God,
whose devoted servant she was, should have destined
her to this last stage of despair! Through all her
bitter trials and sufferings she maintained an undaunted
demeanour. Were her “Voices” hushed
now that she prayed for death? When some English
bigots approached to taunt her, she answered meekly:
“<i>Je sais bien que les Anglois me feront mourir</i>”
(I know perfectly well that the English will put me
to death).</p>

<p>A year’s captivity and cruelty, harsh and revolting,
found the spotless, unselfish, and pious “Maid of
Orléans” in her twentieth year&mdash;alas! so young to
die&mdash;a human wreck; but, mercifully, an end was
put to her sufferings at Rouen on May 30, 1431.
Burnt to death in the market-place,&mdash;calling upon
Jesus, Mary, Michael, Catherine, and Margaret,&mdash;her
fiendish murderers hardly allowed the fire to cool
before they raked up her poor grey ashes, and then
cast them with maledictions into the swirling Seine.
So perished Jeanne d’Arc, the child of God, the
deliverer of her country. Now her place is among
the saints: she is St. Jeanne d’Arc.</p>

<p>It was said that her heart was found intact after
the fire had burnt itself out, and that as one stooped
to pick it up a white dove fluttered before his face!</p>

<p>Ill news travels apace. René de Bar <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>et Lorraine
heard of the tragedy at Rouen, and was broken-hearted.
He dismissed his captains, his courtiers,
and his minstrels, and shut himself up in his castle
at Clermont, where he chided his soul with tears and
fastings. His was the bitter cry: “<i>Ma Royne
blanche, Jeanne, est mort&mdash;helas! ma Royne est
mort!</i>”</p>

<p>The heart, too, of Charles, the King, reproached
him before he died; he could never really have forgotten
La Pucelle. A little girl was born to him
and Queen Marie six months after Jeanne’s martyrdom;
her name was “<i>Jeanne</i>,” as he said, “<i>en reconnaissance
et pour mes péchés</i>.”</p>

<p>In the Register of Taxes the space against Domremy
was left vacant until the great revolution, except
for the entry: “<i>Néant, à cause de la Pucelle</i>.” Her
parents’ cottage is still preserved, although the Bois
Chènus is no more. The memory of Jeanne d’Arc
will never die.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">MARIE D’ANJOU&mdash;“LA PETITE REINE DE BOURGES”</span></h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>“The little Queen of Bourges,”&mdash;so called partly in
derision, partly in pity,&mdash;but all the same one of the
noblest and best Queens who ever shared the sovereign
throne of France: “noble,” not so much in
gradation of rank as in distinction of character;
“best,” or “good,” not in the sense of mock righteousness,
but in the interpretation of whole-heartedness.</p>

<p>Marie d’Anjou was the eldest daughter of King
Louis II. and Queen Yolande of Sicily-Anjou-Naples-Provence.
Born at Angers, October 14, 1404, she
and her younger brother, René, four years her junior,
grew up to love one another almost distractedly. So
intense was this fraternal affection that their solicitous
and resourceful mother viewed it with apprehension,
fearing its consequences,&mdash;if left unchecked or undiverted
into a more natural channel,&mdash;the cloister.
It was no part of the excellent training the Queen
provided for her offspring to hide their futures under
the garb of religion; she had lofty ambitions for all
her children, and those ambitions she lived to see
realized.</p>

</div>

<p>Marie d’Anjou’s betrothal and marriage to Charles
de Ponthieu, Dauphin of France, in 1422, was a
supreme master-stroke of statecraft which only such
a remarkable mother and Queen as Yolande of Sicily-Anjou
could effect. She, with all her prescience,
could not have forecast the future of France proper
and her many sovereign sister States, which was, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>in its
happy fruition, due to that far-seeing nuptial contract.
Marie’s son, Louis XI., made France one
nation much as she is to-day.</p>

<p>When Queen Yolande so anxiously took charge of
the young Dauphin, and had him educated with her
own children, she was quite prepared for any mental
and physical development in her son-in-law which
might be expected to result from his unhappy parentage.
No doubt she did what was possible to correct
faults of heredity and to develop such latent excellencies
as had not been wholly vitiated in the child’s
infancy. Still, we may be sure she had a heart full
of trouble as she witnessed the degeneration of her
son-in-law from paths of probity and virtue.</p>

<p>In truth, the marriage of Princess Marie was, in a
strict sense, a sacrifice and an oblation. The mating
of her dearly loved daughter, a girl of unusual
promise, with a youth of evil ancestry and unworthy
predispositions must have cost the devoted mother
much.</p>

<p>Marie was remarkable for rare beauty of person&mdash;pale,
with perfect features; tall, with a graceful
figure, and distinguished by her regal carriage.</p>

<p>In personal appearance Charles was unattractive:
his figure was insignificant and ill-formed; his head
was unduly large; he had large feet and hands,
whilst his legs were short and bowed, and this caused
an ungraceful gait; his face was sickly-looking and
pock-marked, with a prominent nose, a wide and
sensual mouth, and a heavy jaw; his eyes were small
and somewhat crisscross; he had coarse dark hair
and heavy eyebrows. If his destiny had not been a
throne, he might just as well have found his career in
a stable. With all these personal disadvantages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Charles was naturally warm-hearted and affectionate;
he was possessed of a cool judgment, very affable and
considerate, and, when roused, a very lion in the way.
The marks of his evil mother’s influence never left
him; the crushing of his natural inclinations and
opportunities in childhood warped and unbalanced his
mental calibre.</p>

<p>It was said scoffingly of him by those who were
bereft of feeling: “<i>Le Dauphin est un fou, fils d’un
insensé et d’une prostituée</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_A_7" id="FNanchor_A_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_7" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Jean Juvenal des
Ursins perhaps went too far in the opposite direction,
for in 1433 he wrote in his “Chronicle” concerning
the King: “<i>Sa vie est plaisante à Dieu; il n’y-a-en
aucun vice</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_B_1" id="FNanchor_B_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_1" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>The first notice we find of the life of Marie
d’Anjou, however, does not refer to her union with
Charles VII., but her betrothal, when only five years
old, to Jehan de Beaux, Prince of Taranto, her kinsman.
He was the son of the Prince of Taranto who
accompanied King Louis II., Marie’s father, on his
romantic journey to Perpignan, in 1399, to welcome
Princess Yolanda d’Arragona. Descended in direct
line from Charles, first Duke of Anjou, younger
brother of St. Louis IX., his grandfather was
Philippe, second son of Charles III. and Marguerite
of France. Through the last-named Princess a sad stain
besmirched the shield of the silver lilies. Jehanne
and Blanche de Luxembourg, daughters of Otto IV.,
Count of Burgundy, married respectively King
Philippe the “Tall” and King Charles the “Fair”
of France. Charged with witchcraft, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
imprisoned for life in the Château de Dourdan, where
they were tonsured, scourged, and tortured&mdash;although
they were the most beautiful and most highly
cultured women of their day&mdash;together with their
sister-in-law Marguerite, but she returned to her
husband in 1314. Their terrible experiences were
made traditional in the family, and, naturally, did
not conduce to success in courtship.</p>

<p>No doubt the idea which fixed itself in the minds
of Louis II. and Yolande with respect to this
betrothal was the strengthening of the claims of
Anjou, of the younger line, upon the crown of
Naples, by the alliance of the two branches of the
house. Why this arrangement was set aside, or
when, it is hard to say. Some chroniclers aver that
the young Prince was drowned at sea off Taranto;
others, that he had different views; and, more likely
than all, others attribute the renunciation to the
action of Queen Yolande, who, directly she had
obtained charge of the person of the young Dauphin
Charles, determined a more brilliant match politically,
if a less attractive one psychologically.</p>

<p>Possibly Queen Yolande hardly realized, at the
date of that auspicious marriage, how its consummation
would affect herself. High-toned as she was,
and assertive of Anjou’s prestige, she could not know
that Queen Isabeau’s absolute declension from rectitude
would, by force of contrast alone, throw her
own worthy aims into emphatic prominence. That
marriage was the opening of the portals of imperial
interest to the personal guidance of the strongest
mind and will in France. She became actually the
power on the throne, not behind it. Her hand
directed the issues of life and death betwee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>n the rival
Powers&mdash;France and England. Yolande became at
once the ruler of France and the dictator of her
foreign policy. What has history to say about all
this? Nothing, or next to nothing. Historians,&mdash;the
most narrow-minded and most easily biassed of
writers,&mdash;have not cared to trace and teach the
ethics of the personality of this ruler of men and
States.</p>

<p>The genesis of the paramount influence of women
in the public and private life of France was undoubtedly
in the reign of Charles VII. He was
successively in the hands of Isabeau, his unworthy
mother; of Yolande, his noble mother-in-law; of
Marie, his much-enduring wife; and of Agnes Sorel,
his inspiring mistress. Happily for him, he was
withdrawn early from the immediate care of Queen
Isabeau, but her intrigues later on brought out the
latent bad elements of his character. What saving
grace was his, was his through Yolande of Sicily-Anjou.
His wife and his chief mistress were given
him for two distinct purposes: Marie kept the wolf
from the door and emboldened her faint-hearted
spouse, whilst Agnes cheered his troubled spirit and
impelled his motive-power. There is a quatrain
of Francis I. which is interesting from the fact that
his versification leaves it doubtful whether Marie or
Agnes was actually his good genius: he names <i>both</i> in
the first line:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Gentille Marie (Agnès), plus d’honneur tu mérite,</div>
<div class="verse">La cause étant de France recouvrer;</div>

<div class="verse">Close nonain ou bien dévot hermite.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></div>
<div class="english">

<div class="verse">But thou wast born to adorn the cloister,</div>
<div class="verse">Encloséd nun or dedicated sister.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Marie and René d’Anjou and Charles de Ponthieu
were educated together, and for four years or more
were inseparable companions. The betrothal of
Charles and Marie was effected at the Palace of the
Louvre, December 18, 1413, in the presence of the
King and Queen of France and of the King and
Queen of Sicily-Anjou. Charles VI. was then still
King of France, and fully in possession of his senses.
His troubles, political and mental, ranged from 1417
to 1422, when he had become no more than nominal
Sovereign, driven from place to place, crushed,
depressed, and suffering. Until his malady became
hopeless, he was noted for his nobility of endurance,
his chivalry of deportment, and his unselfish devotion
to his duty. His Don Quixotic sort of life, however,
was a mixture of smiles and frowns&mdash;joys and
sorrows. Such a wife and mother as Queen Isabeau
proved herself to be was quite enough to shatter the
patience and the peace of the most stolid of men.
There was not a more unhappy family in all France
than that of its principal Sovereign, nor a more
miserable home than that of its King.</p>

<p>Still, there were not wanting human touches which
paint the character of King Charles VI. in sympathetic
colours. In the King’s room at the Castle of
Blois is a superb piece of tapestry, among many
others, embroidered with the “Story of the Seigneur
and Châtelaine de Courrages.” The “<i>Annales
Français</i>” recount the following narrative: “The
Seigneur de Courrages was called upon by the
Parliament of Paris to fight in the ‘Lists’ with
a certain Knight, Jehan Le Gris, for the honour
of his wife, the Dame de Courrages. During the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
absence of her spouse in the Holy Land, the fair
châtelaine gave her favours to an urgent lover, the
Seigneur Le Gris, and he made love to her, quite
naturally, in return. King Charles VI. was presiding
at a tournament, and he noted the presence of
the lady in question, but was amazed at her effrontery;
for she was seated, superbly attired, in her state
chariot, in view of the whole assemblage, whereas
the custom of the time should have found her upon
her knees in her closet, praying for her good man.
The King despatched a herald to the impudent
hussy, with a message that ‘it is inconceivable that
anyone lying under so grievous a reproach should
assume herself to be innocent till such time as that
innocence shall have been made apparent.’ The
brazen dame was ordered at once to dismount from
her carriage and retire to her <i>manoir</i>. She was
unwilling to bow to the royal command, and, hearing
of this, the King sent another messenger, who was
instructed to conduct the fair and frail delinquent
beneath a scaffold, where she was ordered to cry
aloud to God for mercy, and to the King for
clemency. In the issue of arms, luckily for her,
fortune favoured her husband, who unhorsed his
adversary, and, after pinning him to the ground with
his sword, compelled him to confess the villainies he
had committed with his wife. Then the unfortunate
man was hurried off to the scaffold,&mdash;beneath which
Dame de Courrages was humbly kneeling,&mdash;and there
and then hung up by the neck by way of justification
of his miserable sweetheart.” What happened to the
frail woman the chronicler has failed to tell; probably
the Seigneur de Courrages took his erring wife home
and administered a well-deserved flagellation in th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>e
privacy of his bedchamber, and condemned her to
a period of imprisonment in the family dungeon upon
a spare diet of bread and water! Such was the
wholesome discipline for marital infidelity in the days
of chivalry!</p>

<p>The marriage of Charles, Count of Ponthieu, and
Marie, Princess of Sicily-Anjou, was solemnized at
St. Martin at Tours, January 15, 1422. It was a
year of rejoicing in France, for on May Day her King
by descent, Charles VI., and her King by conquest,
Henry V., entered Paris riding side by side in a
splendid triumph of peace. Charles’s reason had
returned to him with the return of happier days, and
although the spectre of Isabeau was beside him, he
managed to retain his senses and his vigour until
October 21, when death mercifully heralded a new
reign and a new régime in Paris.</p>

<p>The Dauphin and Dauphine spent their short
honeymoon at Loches and Bourges, whence they
were called to attend the Kings in Paris, and there
they remained till Charles VI. died. Thereafter
troubles once more devastated fair suffering France:
the peace was broken, and a broken band of fugitives
fled the capital. The Court sought refuge at Bourges.</p>

<p>“The King by misfortune in the warres grew so
behindhand, both in fame and estate, that amongst
other afflictions hee was subject to reproach and
poverty, so that he dined in his small chamber
attended only by his household servants. Pothou
and La Hire, coming to Châteaudun to ask for
succour, found him at table with no more than a
rump of mutton and two chickens. He had neither
wine nor dessert, and only two attendants, whilst his
carriage had no relay of horses and only two g<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>rooms.
He was reproached for his love of fair Agnes
(Sorel), but the Bishop of St. Denis reported that hee
loved her onely for her pleasing behaviour, eloquent
speech, and beauty; and that he never used any
lascivious action unto her, nor never touched her
beneath the chin.”</p>

<p>The <i>Comptes de la Royne Marie</i> record that the
King and Queen were reduced to eat their meals off
common pewter dishes, that they had little or no
change of linen, and that the Queen sold all her
jewels to purchase food and other necessaries. The
townsfolk of the neighbourhood as well as the
nobility contributed liberally to their Sovereigns’
wants. Jacques Cœur of Bourges in particular
rendered them hospitality, for he was accustomed to
send in daily the royal supper at his own expense.
Cœur was a merchant, a jeweller, and a wine-grower,
and waxed rich in trade, but never wavered in his
loyalty. He became Charles’s treasurer, but after
advancing him nearly 300,000 gold crowns, he was
for some unknown reason cast into prison and condemned
to execution and the confiscation of his goods.
Queen Marie pleaded for their faithful subject, and
gained his reprieve, but Jacques Cœur never recovered
his liberty nor his property.</p>

<p>A gory stain was dashed upon the lily shield of
France when the Duke of Burgundy was basely slain
by Tanneguy de Châtel in the King’s presence. He
had been one of Charles’s most devoted adherents, for
he it was who, in 1418, carried off the youthful
Dauphin, wrapped in a piece of arras, for safety to the
Bastile, and whence he was allowed to escape to
Poitiers. It was a time of terrible disaster. Paris
was in open revolution, and all the possessions <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>of the
Crown were threatened with destruction. The
English were marching all over France unopposed,
for the French Court and Government were divided
by the feuds of rival leaders. On June 12 the
starving populace of the capital burnt the Hôtel de
Ville, the Temple, and prison. Women were seized,
outraged, and killed, and 1,600 murdered bodies were
scattered in the streets and squares. The Count of
Armagnac was the chief supporter of the Dauphin’s
party, but Queen Isabeau joined hands with Jean
“sans Peur,” Duke of Burgundy, against her
husband,&mdash;alas! now quite imbecile,&mdash;and her only
son.</p>

<p>A peace was patched up, and it was arranged that
the Dauphin and the Duke should meet for mutual
satisfaction at Montereau. The latter had no
suspicion of foul-play, and Charles had no inkling
of what was in de Châtel’s mind. The meeting was
arranged upon the stone bridge crossing the Seine, on
September 10, 1419. There the Dauphin, in full
armour, awaited his rival’s approach. The Duke
passed the two barriers on the bridge assured by the
words: “Come if you please, Monseigneur. Fear
not; the Dauphin is awaiting you.” At the young
Prince’s feet the proud Jean knelt and did homage,
but Charles put out no hand to raise him graciously
nor paid him any compliment, but brusquely exclaimed:
“Monseigneur, you and the Queen have
disgraced France and me. I command you to leave
that wicked woman alone and go back in peace to
your dominions.”</p>

<p>The Duke, astounded, rose, and was about to offer
some uncomplimentary reply, when he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>was struck
down by Tanneguy de Châtel with his battle-axe, as
he hissed out: “Thou art a traitor! Go thy way,
base Burgundy!” Twenty swords leaped from their
scabbards and finished the dastardly deed, and Charles,
shocked beyond expression, mounted his horse and
galloped off. Queen Isabeau was at Troyes, where
she had been exiled by her son’s advisers, and the
tragic death of her confederate roused the whole fury
of her nature. She assembled the chief citizens, and
made them an impassioned harangue:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Consider the horrors, faults, and crimes, perpetrated
in this kingdom of France by Charles, soi-disant
Dauphin of Vienne. It is here and now agreed
that our son Henry, King of England, and our dear
nephew, Philippe, Duke of Burgundy, shall not enter
into relations with the said Charles.”</p>

<p>The assassination of the Duke of Burgundy
weighed heavily upon the conscience of Charles;
he never concealed his wish that his mother’s
colleague should come by his end, but he never put
his desire into exact words.</p>

<p>The year 1422 saw Marie d’Anjou seated, at
least metaphorically, upon the throne of France.
Both Kings of France died soon after her marriage,&mdash;Henry
V. on August 31, and Charles VI. on
October 21,&mdash;and Charles VII. and Marie were
proclaimed King and Queen of France at Mehun-sur-Yèvre
in Berry on November 10 following.
They were crowned in Poitiers Cathedral on
Christmas Day, where the new King had established
his Parliament.</p>

<p>The King and Queen made many progresses
through their circumscribed dominions. The first
was in the summer of 1423, when they made a
state entry also into Angers, and heard Mass at
the Cathedral of St. Maurice. They presented to
the Chapter two superb pieces of tapestry, depicting
the Old and New Testaments. The Queen’s brother,
Louis III., was of course in Italy, but the Duke
of Bar-Lorraine and the Duchess Isabelle were there
supporting the Queen-mother Yolande in rendering
gracious hospitalities; the citizens provided a
mystery-play, and the Court a tournament. The
royal couple were lodged in the castle, from the
gateway of which Queen Marie addressed the
assemblage of people: “<i>Vos citoyens et habitans de
la ville d’Angiers soyeant toujours loyaux et fidèles
à vostre sovereyns, et aussi des beaulx amis vers la
couronne de France, laquelle je porte moi même</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_A_8" id="FNanchor_A_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_8" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
Vociferous plaudits hailed this declamation, and both
Queen Yolande and Duke René made patriotic
addresses.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_8" id="Footnote_A_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_8"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> “You noble citizens and good inhabitants of this worthy city
of Angers were ever famous for loyalty and fidelity to your
Sovereigns, and, moreover, the best of friends to the Crown of
France, which you see I wear.”</p>

</div>

<p>Five years later Charles and Marie entered
Anjou and took up their residence at Saumur, where
the King received the homage of no less a fellow-Sovereign
than the Duke of Brittany, this being
due to the tactful policy of the Queen-mother.
Charles also had a request to place before the loyal
Angevines: he wanted money and men to carry on
the ceaseless warfare against the English. In this
he admirably succeeded, and through Duke René
he gained help from Lorraine and Bar besides.</p>

<p>Marie, though the consort of a fugitive penniless
King, had a suite worthy of herself and of her
parentage and rank; the Queen-mother saw to that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Her Controller was Hardoin de Mailly, and her
Master of Horse Jacques Odon de Maulevrier, a
devoted friend of her brother, Duke René. The
Queen’s four <i>Dames d’Honneur</i> were Catherine
Bourgoing, Aimée de Beauvais, Philippe de la
Rochefoucault, and Jeanne Sorel. Her Maids of
Honour were Marie du Couldray, Jeanne de la
Grosse, Catherine de Beauvais, Jeannett la Garrelle,
Hervée Catherine de Montplaie, and Jehanne
Biardelle, with three quite young girls whose Christian
names alone have been preserved&mdash;Felize, Geffeline,
and Jacquette&mdash;perhaps pet names.</p>

<p>Duke René, ever a liberal-minded and open-handed
Prince, gave each of his sister’s ladies a robe of
richest <i>aigneaulx</i> fur, with crimson satin lining, and
twenty skins of martens for bordering their kirtle
bodices. Each robe cost 16 florins (= £12), and was
supplied by the Queen-mother’s furrier at Angers,
one Martin Chebiton.</p>

<p>The immodest fashions set by Queen Isabeau and
the ladies of her Court, and their outrageous modes
of headgear, did not go unrebuked by the better
sort of clergy. A very famous preaching friar, one
Thomas Correcte, a Carmelite monk from Brittany,
in particular inaugurated a crusade against feminine
extravagances through the North of France and in
Flanders during the second decade of the fifteenth
century. He further strenuously denounced the
dignified clergy who kept fashionable mistresses.
He was welcomed heartily by the burghers of the
towns through which he passed, and conducted to a
special pulpit erected in the market-place, adorned
with rich hangings and a gigantic crucifix. Guards
of honour and musicians were at his service, and,
in spite of opposition and natural predilections,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span> the
clergy fell into line with the popular fancy, and rang
their bells on his arrival. His denunciations were
quite in accord with the feelings of the people, but
they incited the rougher element to take the law
into their own hands. Squads of youths paraded
the public thoroughfares in search of errant dames,
and no sooner had their gaze alighted upon a lady
of degree, coiffured <i>à l’outrance</i>, than a flight of
stones, deftly aimed, quickly made havoc of her
headgear. The popular cry, “<i>Un hennin! un
hennin! à bas les hennins!</i>” produced a panic, so
that the women dared hardly sally forth from their
own doors. It was said that the friar personally
organized these demonstrations, and even paid the
lads to disenchant the fair sex by forcibly pulling
down their hideous superstructures. At all events,
women with dishevelled heads and disordered attire
ran hither and thither helpless and defenceless.
The worthy and enthusiastic evangelist had, however,
an alternative fashion with which modest
women might cover their heads and breasts. He
prescribed the universal habit of wearing plain
<i>chapelles</i>, the ordinary caps of peasant women. The
raid, however, ceased to terrify the determined
votaries of eccentricity in dress, and, as Monstrelet,
the historian, pithily puts it, “Snails, when anybody
passes near them, draw in their horns; but when
the danger is past they put them forth again.” The
<i>hennin</i>, so called by Friar Correcte, became still
more gigantic and grotesque, although Queen Marie,
backed by her good mother, Queen Yolande, made loud
protests and refused their favours to transgressors.</p>

<p>With respect to indecency in dress, the preacher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
insisted upon running a thick cord between the men
and women of his audiences. The mixing of the
sexes in public he gravely denounced, and the bareness
of women’s breasts and the tightness of men’s
hose excited his most eloquent tirades. The reason
of the cord he quaintly phrased: “I perceive that
sly doings will be going on!” The King of Sicily,
Louis III., and Duke René, were quite in accord with
the friar’s philippics; but the “King of Bourges”
was another sort of man, and much of the coolness
which existed between himself and Queen Marie was
due to her moderation in dress and quietness of
manner. Charles, it was said, chanced to hear the
friar one day at Ponthieu, where he was in residence,
and ordered him to keep silence and depart. The
friar retired to his monastery after a year of
eloquence and exertions, but his animadversions upon
the lives of the higher clergy led to his being
summoned to Rome, to answer to certain charges
of breach of monkish discipline and errors of doctrine.
The poor man seems to have felt his position keenly,
so keenly, indeed, that to escape judgment he jumped
out of the window of his cell and decamped. Being
quickly captured, he was arraigned before the Holy
Office of the Inquisition, and condemned to be burnt
as a heretic. Perhaps he deserved punishment for
his unguarded language, but he paid dearly indeed
as a reformer of gay women’s fashions and gross
parsons’ passions!</p>

<p>The years 1427 and 1428 saw France plunged in
warfare. King Charles shook himself, metaphorically,
and registered a vow that he would drive out
every “desecrating English dog.” He bestirred himself,
and led forlorn ho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>pes here and there, only to
meet with disaster; and then he gave way to despair,
and declared that he would do no more for France or
for himself. Queen Marie, with true Anjou-Aragon
grit, chided him with his faint-heartedness, and one
day she surprised him greatly by appearing in a full
suit of armour and armed, and declared that “If you,
Charles of France, will not lead your troops, I will!”
Her example was contagious, for within a week scores
of loyal, devoted women assumed mail and stood for
the weal or woe of France. These heroic doings
were noised abroad, and possibly they had effect in a
very unexpected quarter, for in 1429 another heroine
appeared in armour from the eastern frontier of
France, and made good woman’s claim to military
prowess. Thus quaintly wrote Monstrelet of her:</p>

<p>“In the course of this year (1429) a young girl
called Jehanne, about twenty years of age, and
dressed like a man, came to Charles, King of France,
at Chinon. She was born in the village of Droimy,
on the borders of Burgundy and Lorraine, not far
from Vaucouleurs. She had been for some time an
ostler and chambermaid at an inn, and had shown
much courage in riding horses to water and in other
feats unusual for young women to do. She called herself
a ‘Maiden inspired by the Divine Grace,’ and said
that she was sent to restore Charles to his kingdom.”</p>

<p>Very little has been recorded of what Queen Marie
felt and said concerning that strange visitor. Nobody
in all that recklessly gay Court at Chinon viewed the
coming of the maid of Domremy more eagerly or
more hopefully than did she. She had failed to
rouse the King to strike a new blow for his throne, it
is true, but she anxiously prayed that this heaven-sent
village girl might be the means of doing so.
The Queen gave La Pucelle a most sympathetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
welcome. The mysteries of devotion and the dictates
of religion had in her a very reverent disciple. Apartments
were prepared for Jeanne’s reception quite near
her own boudoir and private oratory, and its priest
was placed at her disposal.</p>

<p>If Jeanne was dumbfounded at the spectacle of a
King wholly apathetic to the duties of his high station,
and of a Court abandoned, in the midst of dire
disaster, to all the frivolities of the idle and the dissolute,
she had at least one solace. The beautiful and
serious face of the young Queen was to her a comfort
and a stay. Looking from one bedizened beauty to
another in that fatuous assembly, her eyes fastened
themselves upon the one figure that was dissimilar to
the rest,&mdash;the figure of a good woman, the daughter
of the good Queen Yolande. She looked to her like
what she conceived of her own saintly Margaret, of
the Bois de Chènus. Marie received her unsophisticated
visitor with emotion. She entered fully into
her story, and conversed daily with her in private
about herself, her home, her mission, and her
“voices,” and thus she gained the girl’s confidence
and her love. If Jeanne had conceived profound
veneration for Queen Yolande,&mdash;she even called her
“my St. Catherine,”&mdash;her sentiments towards Queen
Marie were those of the most tender affection. Marie,
so near her own age, so modest, so simple, and so
true, became Jeanne’s confidant and loving patroness.
To Marie the mere sight of the girl and her frank,
girlish ways was quite sufficient, had she sought for
proof positive, to dispel from her mind any suspicions
which may have been forced upon her about Jeanne’s
relations with her dear brother, René de Bar. Of
course, she knew him far too well to credit any tales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of faithlessness or dishonour on his part. He and
she had been, till he was carried off to Bar-le-Duc by
the good Cardinal Louis de Bar, the very dearest and
most intimate of playmates in and out of school.
Their intercourse had never ceased; such never fails
between kindred souls, though parted by hemispheres.
René was a just man still, and a true knight. Jeanne
likened him to her own St. Michael.</p>

<p>All through Jeanne’s ordeals,&mdash;first the open scoffs
of the courtiers and servitors at Chinon, then the
covert jeers of the divines and busybodies at Poitiers,
and lastly the base insinuations of libertines and
adventurers,&mdash;the Queen stood by La Pucelle.
Queen Yolande’s panel of matrons found Marie’s
tribute of the utmost value; she staked her royal
prerogative upon the girl’s absolute chastity, and the
prying, posturing Court bowed to her decision.</p>

<p>If Queen Yolande clothed the maid in shining
armour within the great Hall of Audience of Angers
Castle, on the eve of the advance upon Orléans,
Queen Marie knelt with her in prayer in the solemn
choir of Angers Cathedral from Vespers to Compline.
How much of her strength of will and the promptness
of her action Jeanne d’Arc gained from the
whole-hearted favour of these two good Queens the
world may never know, but this much we all can
apprehend: that unselfish human sympathy is a more
mobile force than the uncertainties of Providence.</p>

<p>We can never know why Queen Marie was denied
the satisfaction of witnessing and sharing in the
coronation of Charles at Reims. She was living
quietly at Bourges when the King set off for the
metropolitical cathedral under the conduct of La<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Pucelle and of her brother René. She was prepared
for the expedition, and her robes of state were ready
for the ceremony, when suddenly Charles commanded
her to remain where she was, saying that the march
was full of dangers and quite impossible for the Queen
and her ladies. La Pucelle begged the King to
recall his prohibitions, saying that Queen Marie was
quite as worthy as was he to receive a crown. The
poor Queen put by her finery,&mdash;perhaps not altogether
sorrowfully,&mdash;and went to reflect awhile at Gien upon
the untowardness of human affairs in general and the
inconsequences of Charles in particular. Her parting
with Jeanne was affecting; Queen and peasant embraced
each other affectionately&mdash;and never more
they met.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>After the disastrous battle of Bulgneville, Duchess
Isabelle of Lorraine set off to Vienne in Dauphiné, a
province which ever remained faithful to the royal
house of France, where the Court of Charles VII.
was established, to claim his aid for her captive
husband languishing at Bracon. In her train went
her fairest Maid of Honour, Agnes Sorel, just twenty
years of age; she was Mistress of the Robes to the
Duchess. She made an immediate impression upon
the jejune King, who urged Isabelle to allow her to
be transferred to the suite of his consort&mdash;perhaps by
way of <i>quid pro quo</i>. Queen Marie added her
entreaties to the monarch’s suit. She had failed
completely to rouse her husband; perhaps she
thought Agnes would be more successful. The
Duchess would not hear of the arrangement, and the
beauteous Maid of Honour was anything but eager to
be the creature of so unattractive a master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Happier days, however, dawned both for King
René and for King Charles, and jousts, pageants, and
mystery-plays, were in full fling everywhere. At
Angers, in particular, everything was gay and merry
for the welcome of King René to his ancestral home,&mdash;after
his duress at Tour de Bar,&mdash;and of Queen
Isabelle. Agnes Sorel was still attached to her royal
mistress, and, although unmarried, she numbered her
lovers by the score.</p>

<p>Agnes Sorel, or Soreau, was born at Fromenteau,
on the verge of the forest of Fontainebleau, on
May 17, 1409. Her father was the Sieur Jehan
Soreau, and her mother Catherine de Maignelais, who
were quiet country people and occupied in agricultural
pursuits. She had a younger sister, Jehanne, to
whom she was devoted, and mothered her when Dame
Catherine died. Her uncle, Raoul de Maignelais,
followed the profession of arms, and made himself a
name as a dauntless warrior in the service of King
Charles VI. He had an only daughter, Antoinette,
born 1420, who, her mother dying when she was
very young, was confided to the care of her aunt,
Catherine Soreau, and was brought up by her with
her own little daughters. Nothing is positively
known about Agnes’s girlhood, but in 1423 the two
cousins entered the service of Isabelle, the Duchess
of Bar-Lorraine. Bar-le-Duc, ever since the advent of
the famous Countess Iolande, had been remarkable for
the number of lovely damsels and comely youths
from all parts of France attached to the “Court of
Love,” under the patronage and maintenance of the
Dukes and Duchesses. The young Duchess appears
to have taken a particular fancy to fair Agnes, due
no doubt to the girl’s physical beauty and mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
brilliance. Few maidens at that merry Court
excelled her in good looks, grace of figure, and
distinction of deportment. Bourdigne, the Court
chronicler, says “she was the most lovely girl in
France.” She sang divinely,&mdash;a natural gift,&mdash;and
danced bewitchingly, and gave promise of a splendid
career. She was welcomed at Chinon with delight
both by the King and Queen.</p>

<p>Perhaps one reason why Agnes’s presence was so
grateful to the taciturn and indolent monarch was
that she dressed so superbly, and yet so tastefully.
The Queen and her ladies were subject to strict
Court sartorial conventions, but the Demoiselle de
Fromenteau knew no such restrictions. One day
“<i>la Belle des Belles</i>,” as everybody called her,
appeared as “Cleopatra,” another as “Diana,” and
a third as “Venus,” and so on. Her costumes were
of the richest and the thinnest. Her abundant
beautiful brown hair, too, she dressed not only for
the <i>hennin à la mode</i>,&mdash;bunched over the ears or
gathered into a chignon,&mdash;but <i>à la calotte galonnée</i>:
frizzed out, or <i>en simple résille</i>&mdash;in a net, or <i>à tours</i>,
thrown round and round her head in massive coils.
Agnes was short of stature, but she made up for
this by wearing Venetian <i>zilve</i>, or high pattens,
beautifully embroidered with silk and pearls. Her
<i>decollétage</i> was never vulgar or immodest, like that
of the King’s mother, but her well-formed bust was
covered lightly by white lace or thinnest gauze. A
string of pearls usually embraced her well-shaped
throat. One article of clothing was peculiarly her
own invention. Whilst the ladies of the Court, and
even Queen Marie herself, wore serge chemises, hers
were of fine Flemish linen. Very many of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
tasteful fancies were taken up by the ladies about
her, and Queen Marie herself followed suit by discarding
the daily use of the <i>hennin</i> and the stiff and
heavy fur borders of her kirtle. She, too, had hair
as fair as that of Agnes, and she was privately quite
as proud of it as was her <i>Dame d’Honneur</i>, for so “<i>la
Belle des Belles</i>” had become.</p>

<p class="captionright"><i>To face page 194</i></p>

</div>

<p>A pretty story is told of “<i>la Belle des Belles</i>”
with respect to the melancholy moods of King
Charles. One day Charles was more than usually
depressed, and, try how she would, Queen Marie
could not cheer him; so she sent for Agnes, who at
once ran to her mistress, and, then entering the
King’s presence, knelt at his feet and fondled his
knees. “Sire,” she said, “when I was a very little
girl a soothsayer told my mother that I should be
the plaything of a King who would be the most
valiant in Europe. I thought that your Majesty
was such an one, but I find that I am mistaken.
Perhaps I ought to have sought the Court of Henry
rather than that of Charles!” The King frowned,
but the bantering words had struck home, and he
raised himself and Agnes, and, kissing her affectionately,
replied: “No, my sweet, you have no need to
seek Henry. I am your valiant King!”</p>

<p>Agnes held Charles under a spell. She was his
“Queen of Hearts”; he denied her nothing, her will
was his. Her influence was complete, and if the
poor neglected Queen had thrown upon her frail
shoulders the heavy weight of sovereignty, it was
fond Agnes’s fair hair that wore the light crown of
gaiety. Her tact and unselfishness were remarkable;
every domestic squabble and every State imbroglio
were quietly and swiftly settled when she joine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>d the
fray. Charles could not do enough for his sweetheart.
Besides costly presents of jewellery and
clothes, he bestowed upon her the county of Penthièvre,
the lordships of Roquecesière, Issoudon, and
Vernon, with the Castle of Breauté and its great
woods of pine-trees.</p>

<p>Agnes had by Charles four daughters; the
youngest died in infancy, but the rest grew up, like
their mother, famed for good looks and attractive
manners, and were legitimatized and married well.
Catherine de France, the eldest, wedded, in 1464,
Jacques de Brézé, Comte de Maulevrier, and became
the accomplished châtelaine of his splendid castle near
Saumur. Alas for the joys of married life! the
Count, himself unfaithful and intolerant, grew
suspicious of his wife’s conduct,&mdash;she had attracted
the attention of King René, among others,&mdash;accused
her of adultery, and stabbed her as she was sallying
forth one dark November day, 1477, bent upon an
errand of charity. Their son, Louis de Brézé
became the husband of the celebrated Diane de
Poitiers, in 1515, before her liaison with King
Henry II. Marguerite de France married, in 1458,
Seigneur Olivier de Coëtivi, and died in 1473; and
Jeanne de France became the wife of Antoine de
Benil, Comte de Sancerre, and received from the
King, her father, a <i>dot</i> of 40,000 <i>écus d’or</i>.</p>

<p>These three daughters were born and educated as
Princesses of the Royal House, in conformity with
the existent code of morals. Queen Marie not only
made no demur at their status, but, acting upon the
advice of good Queen Yolande, her mother, treated
them in every respect as she did her own offspring.
When Agnes’s second daughter was married, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Queen stood by her and gave her rich wedding
presents. Certainly she was not subjected to the
indignity of sharing hearth and home with her
husband’s mistress. Dame Agnes Sorel resided at
her own Castle de Breauté-sur-Marne, and there she
bore him her family. The castle was a bijou residence,&mdash;a
great favourite of Charles,&mdash;and Agnes
made it a habitation of beauty, adorned not alone by
her own gracious presence, but by the attendance of
a brilliant Court, quite outrivalling that of the modest
Queen, and filled her rooms and galleries with the
countless beautiful and costly gifts of her former
devoted mistress, Duchess Isabelle.</p>

<p>Agnes’s ascendancy over Charles VII. was purely
erotic. She exercised no influence whatever upon
the affairs of state, or, indeed, upon anything but what
ministered to his personal pleasure and amusement.
However, she was useful, and indeed invaluable, on
more than one occasion of danger and suspicion.
Unreservedly devoted to her paramour, she was
sensitive of any dereliction of duty and of any
appearance of intrigue. To her was solely due the
detection of the conspiracy of 1449, which, fomented
by the Dauphin, threatened the life of the King.</p>

<p>Marie inspired the fervent love of her son, Louis
the Dauphin, as she did, in truth, the devotion of all
her children. When a stripling of fourteen, he
championed his mother against his father’s mistress;
and when Agnes made a disparaging remark affecting
the Queen, the lad immediately boxed her ears,
and warned her never to repeat the offence in his
hearing! From that day Louis hated “<i>la Belle des
Belles</i>,” and never tired of checking her assumptions.
He even dared to protest personally before his fathe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>r
against the King’s neglect of the Queen and his
partiality for her Lady of Honour. Charles on one
occasion took his son’s strictures seriously to heart,
sent for Marie, bewailed his infidelity, and craved her
pardon. But the wanton monarch’s day of righteousness
was short, for he very soon forgot his son’s
vehemence, and went on fondling his favourite.</p>

<p>“<i>La Belle des Belles</i>” died in childbed on
February 18, 1450. Her end was quite unexpected,
for she had gone on a visit of pleasure to her cousin,
Antoinette de Maignelais, the Baroness of Villerequier,
at the Castle of Mesnil la Belle, near the
far-famed Abbey of Jumièges in Normandy. Her
husband, André de Villerequier, was Chamberlain to
Charles VII., who presented her at her bridal, as a
wedding gift, the three islands, Oléron, Marennes,
and Auvert, at the mouth of the River Charente.
Floral games and spectacles were engaging the
attention of the merry party assembled at the
castle, and Agnes Sorel was the gayest of the gay,
but unfortunately, tripping upon the sash of her
gown, she fell heavily to the ground. She was
carried tenderly to her chamber, and at once her life
was despaired of. She had barely time to make her
confession, and then, calling to mind the example
of St. Mary Magdalen, she called aloud to Heaven
for pardon of her sins and for the prayers of those
standing by. She heard Mass and received the Last
Sacraments, and painfully passed away in her cousin’s
arms. The distracted Baroness laid the dead head
of the lovely Agnes gently upon the pillow, closed
the eyes which had spell-bound King Charles and
many more besides, and, weeping bitterly, exclaimed:
“The good God has taken away my Agnes because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
He feared she would never lose her beauty.”</p>

<p>King Charles was not with his sweetheart in her
death, but he grieved and rocked himself in woe.
“Because she was what she was,” he sobbed, “for
that I mourn.” He hastened to Jumièges, and
with every mark of sincere affection he assisted in
placing his Agnes in her coffin. Her heart he had
enclosed in a costly gold vase, which he carried
about with him wherever he went, and when he
died it was deposited by his command beneath a
black marble slab in front of the high-altar of
Jumièges, with the simple epitaph: “Agnes Seurelle&mdash;Dame
de Breauté.” Fair Agnes’s body, still
comely in death, was ultimately translated by Charles
to Loches, and interred in the basement of the King’s
Apartments. Her tomb, surmounted by a statue,
was erected by her royal lover. Upon a block marble
bed reclines a white marble effigy of “<i>la Belle des
Belles</i>,” evidently sculptured after life. The fascinating
features with her sweet smile are beautifully
chiselled, and the graceful figure lightly covered by
a long chemise admirably exhibits her exquisitely-proportioned
form.</p>

<p>Agnes, in a will she made a year before her
death, directed that her body should rest at Jumièges,
and she bequeathed 1,000 <i>écus d’or</i> (= £500) to
the monastery for Masses for the rest of her soul.
She had for years been a munificent benefactress to
the clergy of the abbey. When Charles had joined
his sweetheart in the Paradise of Love, the ungrateful
monks were desirous of removing Agnes’s heart
and its memorial tablet, on the score that she had
led an immoral life; but Louis XI., in spite of his
fierce hatred of his father’s mistress, reproved th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>e
religious, and warned them that, if they determined
to cast out her remains, they must also divest themselves
of the gifts and legacies of their patroness.
“If you,” the new King said, “disturb her ashes, I
shall expect you to hand over to me the gold <i>écus</i>.”
Needless perhaps to say, the worldly-wise Canons
kept the money and the heart.</p>

<p>The death of Agnes Sorel had a terrible effect upon
the subsequent life of Charles the King. She and
Queen Marie between them had managed to keep
him free from amorous imbroglios, but now, with
only his wife’s protestations to guard him, he gave
way to immoderate indulgences, and he, to quote the
French,&mdash;“<i>enlardit sa vie de tenir males femmes en
son hostel!</i>”</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>“Everything must be sacrificed for the glory of
France!” was no empty, echoing cry in a desert; it
was the pleading and persistent cry of a devoted
wife and a patriotic Queen. Into the ears of the
King of France and into the ears of everybody who
was even in the smallest degree likely to be able
to do anything at all for her beloved country, the
admirable Queen Marie poured her complaint. She
stood for the expulsion of the English invaders of
her native soil, and for the composure of the feuds
and jealousies of the French Sovereigns and nobles.
“God and reason,” she went on to exclaim, “are on
my side; rouse you like men and fight!” Surely he
is a coward or a simpleton in whose heart a woman’s
voice and a woman’s taunts fail to enkindle enthusiasm.
All France flocked to do homage to the
“little Queen of Bourges,” to kiss her hand, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
lay their swords at the feet of the King. From
Loches to Chinon and Tours, right down the river
valley of the Rhone, and throughout Dauphiné, that
voice went echoing. The new campaign was hers,
hers the credit, hers the glory, for great deeds were
done that shamed men’s apathy.</p>

<p>Alas! her enthusiasm found faint response in
Charles. A skit of the time denounced him thus:
“<i>Nouvelle du Roy nullement; ne que se il fust à
Romme oue Jherusalemme!</i>”&mdash;“The King is of no
use whatever; he might as well be at Rome or at
Jerusalem!” Still, the Queen did not fail for loyal
soldiers nor for consummate captains; first and foremost
was her beloved brother René, now King of
Sicily-Anjou.</p>

<p>But now enemies more terrible than the hated
English, more insidious than the squabbling Princes,
stalked the broad plains of suffering France&mdash;the
three fell sisters, famine, flood, and fever. The price
of foodstuffs rose portentously; wheat, butter, oil,
and cheese, were a hundred times dearer than their
usual cost. Men grovelled like pigs for offal, and
women and children laid themselves down to die
just where they were. Queen Marie’s tender heart
grieved sorely for her people’s misery. She sold
what jewellery she had left, and pawned her available
property to minister to the prevailing want. And
then a new terror seized the land&mdash;the rivers were
in flood, and what stocks and crops the famine had
left were washed away, and beggary stared the
nation in the face. The Queen instituted pilgrimages
of women to celebrated shrines, and she herself put
on the deepest mourning and spent her time in
prayer. All seemed to be of no avail to stay the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
afflicting hand of Heaven, for no sooner were the
waters abated than the scourge of fever was let loose
on the devoted land of France, and corpses were
flung out of echoing doorways and left for chance
burial, or to be the prey of scavaging dogs. Had
the Day of Judgment dawned? men asked each other,
whilst they promptly covered their mouths against
the infection. Delirium would have seized all the
remnants of the population had not the intrepid
Queen ridden up and down, risking her own precious
life and appealing to one and all to be courageous,
bear all, and hope for better days.</p>

<p>Marie had happy days and proud to cancel days
of gloom and penury. Toulouse was <i>en fête</i>; it was
the month of May, 1435, best loved of all the
children of Mary; and she made a stately entry
into that ancient, loyal city with the King by her
side. Oddly enough, she was mounted on pillion
behind her young son, the Dauphin Louis, then a lad
of twelve. Her vesture was superb&mdash;a blue brocaded
satin robe, bordered heavily with royal ermine. She
was <i>décolletée</i>, her bosom covered with jewels and
chains of gold. Upon her head, rising out of a
regal diadem of flashing gems, she wore a <i>chaperon</i>,
a hood of fine white cambric shaped like a crescent,
raised at the points, and lightly covered with a thin
white gauze veil. Her hair was bunched over her
ears, and carried in a golden jewelled net. Her feet
were shod in white, gold-embroidered kid, and she
wore, after her mother’s fashion, jewelled white kid
gloves. Four Chamberlains, also mounted, held a
state canopy of cloth of gold and white plumes over
their royal mistress and her white charger.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>
<p>A bright day dawned for Queen Marie. It was
the Festival of the Forerunner, June 24, 1436, and
the ancient and loyal city of Tours was decked for the
royal nuptials of the Dauphin. The King and Queen
of France with the good Queen Yolande and their
suite awaited at the Château du Plessis-lès-Tours
the arrival of the young bridal couple. Louis had
gone to meet his bride at Saumur; he was but a boy
of thirteen, small, ill-looking, and not too clever.
Princess Margaret, daughter of James I. of Scotland,
with a following of Scottish nobles and Maids of
Honour, a tall, sprightly girl of twelve, vastly enjoyed
her voyage, and clapped her hands delightedly at the
flowers and fruits of Anjou. She embraced her little
husband-to-be, and took him by the hand as they
stepped on board the state barge in waiting at the
river quay.</p>

<p>Among the bevy of fair maidens who welcomed
the royal bride was Jehanne de Laval, who was
attached to the suite of the Dauphiness. The grand
hall of the castle and state-rooms were hung with
tapestry and lengths of cloth of gold. There the
Sovereigns were seated on a canopied daïs, wearing
their crowns and robes of state. The little Princess
entered the Presence somewhat nervously, still holding
the hand of the young Dauphin, and chaperoned
by her Scottish Mistress of the Robes. Making a
graceful obeisance, Margaret advanced with childlike
confidence, and Queen Marie, rising, went to greet
her young daughter-in-law; she embraced her
tenderly, and introduced her to the King and to
Queen Yolande. The courtiers pressed forward to
kiss the Princess’s hand, and many costly gifts
were laid at her feet. Wearied at length with the
ceremonies, Queen Marie conducted her interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
visitor to her own apartments, where dinner was
served.</p>

<p>The bells of all the churches in Tours set up merry
janglings at dawn next day, and the cathedral was
crowded by a goodly company of wedding guests.
The King and the two Queens were seated on their
thrones. Charles wore a black velvet doublet and
hose, his <i>berretta</i> was of red, and he bore round his
neck a decoration sent from the King of Scotland.
The Queen was arrayed in crimson velvet and ermine.
She wore an abbreviated <i>hennin</i> with a fine lace
fall; her hair was embroidered with gold. The
young Prince was in blue and silver, his bride in
bridal white. Everybody bore wedding favours&mdash;Scottish
heather and French lilies entwined with
white satin ribbons. The Archbishop of Reims performed
the ceremony, accompanied by a number of
Bishops and dignified clergy.</p>

<p>Margaret at once became a great favourite with
the King and Queen. Her Northern vigour and
sweet manners were good credentials; but, unhappily,
the young bridegroom from the first took a dislike
to his consort. She was never happy when he was
present, and her furtive eyes searched in vain for
tokens of affection and <i>camaraderie</i>. “There was
no one,” wrote Philippe de Commines a few years
later, “in all the world whom she dreaded more than
the Dauphin.” Her life was indeed a sad one;
neglected by her husband, misunderstood and disesteemed
at Court, the poor young Dauphiness passed
her time mostly with Queen Marie and in futile
regrets for her dear, dear home in Scotland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Her death came about most unexpectedly, for she
was discovered poisoned,&mdash;rumour had it by her
spouse,&mdash;in her boudoir at Sarry-le-Château, on
August 16, 1444, an ill-used wife of no more than
twenty years of age. Princess Margaret’s fate was
as sad as sad could be&mdash;too young to die. Her last
words,&mdash;the most pathetic ever uttered by an
unhappy woman,&mdash;were addressed to her faithful
chaperon: “A curse on life! don’t speak to me
about it!” No child, perhaps happily, was born of
that ill-starred marriage.</p>

<p>No one wept more bitterly at this mischance than
tender-hearted Queen Marie. She loved her son to
distraction, and he loved her as greatly in return;
and she had learned to love Margaret too, but
nothing that she could say moved Louis to love,
honour, and comfort, his young wife. Calm, crafty,
and selfish, like his father, and vindictive, Louis’s
character may be succinctly stated as he himself
wrote it: “The King knows not how to rule who
knows not how to dissemble.… If my cap should
know my thoughts, I would burn it!”</p>

<p>Queen Marie’s other son, Charles, Duc de Berry,
the last of all her surviving children, born December
28, 1446, was a Prince of no strength of character.
Easily led by others, he became involved in endless
imbroglios, and aided and abetted his elder brother
the Dauphin, in his unfilial conduct towards their
father. Created Duke of Guienne and Duke of
Normandy in 1469,&mdash;after the expulsion of the
English,&mdash;he was a source of constant anxiety and
trouble to his mother. The Queen of Sicily-Anjou,
Isabelle de Lorraine, his godmother, with King
René, took the young Prince in hand, but he did
not well repay their solicitude. Immoral, dissipated,
and in debt, Charles de Berry spent his time <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>in
debauches and intrigues; he was own grandson of
Isabeau the Infamous. Among his many mistresses,
Derouillée de Montereau, widow of Louis d’Amboise,
exercised the greatest influence. She, too, was the
cause of his death, for at lunch one day she placed
a peach in his wineglass, and she challenged Charles
to bite the fruit with her. Her half she swallowed,
and she fell dead in a few minutes, whilst her royal
paramour lingered in acute suffering for three whole
days, and at last succumbed to the poison on May 28,
1472. Whether she caused the fruit to be poisoned
we know not; most likely she knew all about it, and
only followed in the steps of those whose immorality
turns love to hate and sanctity to madness. This
was a characteristic of society in the Renaissance, the
cloven hoof of the old Adam showing beneath the
sumptuous garments of the new man.</p>

<p>As might very well have been expected at a Court
of self-seekers and sycophants, the integrity and unselfishness
of the Queen were goads to slander and
aids to hypocrisy. She was assailed on account of
her absolute faithfulness to the marriage bond and for
her want of personal ambition. Roués could not
understand her; mondaines would not tolerate her;
the King’s favourites and mistresses,&mdash;not Agnes
Sorel, be it said,&mdash;strove all they could to poison his
mind against his consort. The names of many
prominent Princes and courtiers were linked scandalously
with the Queen’s. Arthur de Richemont, son
of Duke Jehan VI. of Brittany, the Constable of
France; Pierre de Giac de la Trémouille, Captain of
the King’s Guards; Étienne Louvet, President of the
Privy Council; and the Count of Dunois, better
known as the “Bastard of Orléans,” were all said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
have shared the Queen’s confidences and her favours.
The latter was thrown, indeed, very much with Her
Majesty, and ranked among the Princes of the Royal
House. Son of the assassinated Duke of Orléans by
an unknown mother, the Duchess brought him up
along with her own children, and she hoped he would
live to avenge his father’s death. The “Bastard”
was the playmate of the children of King Louis II.
of Sicily-Anjou and Queen Yolande, and he and
the Princess Marie were much drawn to one
another.</p>

<p>The two young people were one day in the gardens
of the Hôtel de St. Pol along with the Comte de
Ponthieu,&mdash;Charles VII.,&mdash;and the Princes and Princesses
of Sicily-Anjou, when the Count, wearied of
his forced attentions to the Princess Marie, sauntered
away by himself. Xaintrailles followed him and
remonstrated with him for his coolness to his fiancée.
Charles replied that they were not fully betrothed,
and that he did not admire and did not love Marie.
Xaintrailles told Dunois what the Count had said, and
Dunois, with a scornful laugh, exclaimed: “One
must be dull and blind indeed not to be smitten by
her eyes&mdash;the most beautiful eyes in the whole world,
and quite incapable of seeing the faults of others.”
Dunois was very much in love with the Princess, and
did not conceal his passion, so much so that when he
kissed her hand, as he often did, he also lifted the
hem of her skirt and implanted a kiss there, as a
lover’s token of humility.</p>

<p>Dunois contrived <i>têtes-à-tête</i> as often as he could
with his sweetheart, as he called Marie d’Anjou.
One day, it is said, Charles passed down a sheltered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
path in the gardens, and his companion pointed out
to him a couple love-making in a secluded arbour.
They chided him with the feebleness of his suit, and
told him it would serve him right if Marie married
Dunois. He said he did not care a bit if she did or
if she did not. They were all mere children&mdash;the
Count sixteen, Marie fifteen, and Dunois of a like
age. The intimacy between the Princess and her
lover became embarrassing to the whole Court, but
time went on, and developments were awaited by the
curious and intriguing. A summer’s day came when
some ladies of the Court went wandering about
searching for shady shelters. Right away from the
palace, near a springing fountain, they came upon a
crossing in the path, and there in the sandy dust
they read, written by a stick or something:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Destin qui va m’unir d’une éternelle chaîne</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A l’object de ma haîne&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Cruel destin, arrache de mon cœur</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Une trop vive ardeur.”</div>
<div class="english">
<div class="verse">“Fate which would rivet me with a perpetual chain</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To the object of my deep disdain&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">O, cruel fate! which would snatch from my poor worn heart</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A passion full of ardour on my part.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Puzzling over the meaning of this strange verse,
the ladies beheld the Princess hastening to where
they stood. With heightened colour she asked them:
“What are you doing here? Why are you not with
the Queen of Sicily?” Then effacing the writing
with her foot, she added: “I cannot think why I did
not efface those words; I have committed an indiscretion.
But take note I did not name the unhappy
person who wrote them.” The romance went on unchecked.
Dunois, still under age, very adroitly contrived
to remove the suspicions his conduct had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
aroused in the mind of Queen Yolande, and Marie
took dutifully and silently the maternal reproofs.
Then came the death of Charles VI., and Princess
Marie was proclaimed Queen of France. With more
than a sigh,&mdash;almost a broken heart,&mdash;she set herself
to play her part as a virtuous woman and as a loyal
spouse. Dunois did not renounce his devotion to the
Queen, and she never forgot the love she had borne
him&mdash;a Prince the very antithesis of her husband,
remarkable for personal beauty and mental accomplishment,
just the sort of man all women love. Daily
she poured out her soul before the altar of her private
chapel for strength to be true and faithful, and victory
was hers; but it cost her dear.</p>

<p>This fascinating story of the loves of Count Dunois
d’Orléans and Princess Marie d’Anjou was worked up
by fanatics into a culpable liaison of the Queen. It
grew in vile misrepresentation, and swelled in garbled
facts until it became abhorrent in the ears of all
decent-minded people. Some of Charles’s legitimate
children were said to have been fathered by the
Count. The Queen very wisely refrained from
making replies to the evil stories, the only sensible
way of dealing with them. “Exempt,” as wrote
Varillas, “not only from the faults of the Court, but
still more from suspicion that she had any part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
therein, she had all the same to suffer from the
poison of calumny.” On the other hand, Marie
suffered in patience the disdain and unfaithfulness of
the King, and returned his evil with her good. Her
entire life was a scene of sacrifice and an arena of
benevolence.</p>

<p>Marie, in her quiet, unobtrusive way, did very
much for the correction of morals in Court and
country. Due to her representation, Charles at Toul
abolished the obscene <i>Fête des Fous</i>, which was
observed through his dominions. It was a scandalous
exhibition, an indecent orgy, shared in alike by laity
and clergy. The latter chose a local Pope or Bishop,
to whom for the time the actual Bishop of the
diocese rendered up the attributes of his office. The
mock prelate was enthroned in the cathedral, and
then a wild scene of profanity was witnessed. Men
and women dressed as buffoons, many exposing their
nakedness without shame, joined in licentious dances
and blasphemous songs, and gorged themselves with
roast pork and other coarse viands and intoxicating
beverages served upon the altars. In the holy
censers were burnt common corks and bits of leather;
the holy-water stoups were used for nameless indecencies;
and promiscuous prostitution made each
sacred edifice a brothel and a Gehenna.</p>

<p>Early in the year 1457 Ambassadors from Duke
Ladislaus of Austria came to France to ask from
Charles VII. the hand of his youngest daughter,
Madeleine, a girl of fourteen, and dowered with
beauty if not with wealth. Passing through Lorraine
and Bar, King René greeted them, entertained them
handsomely, and accompanied them to Tours. The
King and Queen of France were at the castle wit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>h
their three daughters,&mdash;Jeanne; Yolande, the wife of
Amadeo IX., Duke of Savoy; and Madeleine,&mdash;and
a numerous and distinguished suite. In the Grand
Salle twelve long tables were placed, each seating
seven guests. At the first were the two Kings and
the Queens with the three Princesses and the Duke
of Savoy. The Masters of Ceremonies were the
Counts Gaston de Foix, Dunois, and de la Marche,
with the Grand Seneschal of France. It was a
typical entertainment&mdash;lavish, long, and laborious.
The first course consisted of white hypocras and
“<i>rosties</i>”&mdash;<i>hors d’œuvres</i>(?)&mdash;served in crystal vessels.
The second course offered <i>grands pâtes de chapons
à haute grasse</i>, with boars’ tongues, and accompanied
by seven kinds of soup&mdash;all served on plates of silver.
The third course presented all kinds of game-birds
with venison and boars’ heads served on silver dishes.
The fourth course was <i>des petites oyseaux</i> on toast
and spit, with prunes and salads, set forth on dishes
of silver gilt. The fifth course consisted of tarts,
orange trifles, candied lemons, and many sorts of
sweetmeats, beautifully arranged on plates and stands
of coloured jewelled glass. The sixth and last course
was hypocras again, but red, served with <i>oublies</i>&mdash;perhaps
macaroons and wafers.</p>

<p>The wines which accompanied this regal menu,
unhappily, are not mentioned by the chronicler, but
the name of Tours in connection with delicacies of
the palate has always been a <i>cachet</i> of excellence;
its cuisine and its cellars are still unsurpassed in
France. The banquet was accompanied by minstrelsy
and masque. King René himself arranged the
musical programme; indeed, he brought with him
some of his famous troubadours. After dinner the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
august company disposed themselves, some to the
merry dance, some to the quiet <i>têtes-à-tête</i>, and some
to cards&mdash;then so fashionable and so much beloved
by the King and Queen of France. A very famous
pack was used, the Queens of the suit being Isabeau
for “Hearts,” Marie for “Clubs,” Agnes Sorel for
“Diamonds,” and Jeanne d’Arc for “Spades,”
Kinged respectively by Charles VI., Louis III.,
Charles VII., and René; and the Knaves, Xaintrailles,
La Hire, Dunois, and Barbazan&mdash;a quaint
conceit!</p>

<p>Upon the death of Louis III., his sister, Queen
Marie, came in for a considerable fortune&mdash;renounced,
be it said, by that most loving of all brothers, René,
in her behalf. It was said that the new Duke
assigned the whole of his revenues from Anjou to
the use of his sister. He settled certain estates upon
her which she very quickly and cleverly turned to
good account. In person the Queen visited her new
properties, dressed plainly in black and without
ceremony, inquired into the condition of the labourers
and the promise of the harvest, and then, calling to
her assistance the well-known financier of Bourges,
Jacques Cœur, opened out business relations with
England. The vineyards of Anjou&mdash;at least, those
bordering the Loire&mdash;were among the most fruitful
in France. These the Ministers of the Queen
exploited, and opened out a very profitable export
trade from the port of La Rochelle. The sweet
white vinous brandies of Annis became established
favourites of English palates. Anjou cheese, too,
was excellent; it still is made from milk of Anjou
cows and goats. <i>Crême de Blois</i> was famous long
before Roquefort, Cantal, or Brie, came into reque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>st,
and with fresh butter was exported largely to
Southampton, much to the profit of Queen Marie’s
exchequer.</p>

<p>These homely touches introduce the student of
“<i>La Vie Privée des Français</i>” to a charming hobby
of the good Queen Marie&mdash;her love of animals and
birds. In the <i>Comptes de Roy René</i> is a letter
to the Agents of the Audit; it is dated July 16,
1458, and is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“By Command of the Queen.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Well-beloved and Right Trusty</span>,</p>

<p>“We have noted that our brother the King
of Sicily (René) has in his house at Rivetes, of which
you, Guillaume Bernart, have the superintendence,
some cocks and hens of good strain, and that they
are very fine, as we have seen. If you are well
disposed, then, the messenger can bring us a cock
and a hen, with a broody hen and her chicks. You
will see that they are in good condition. Do not be
at all fearful of displeasing our royal brother, for we
shall make him both pleased and happy.</p>

<p>“Dearly beloved, may Our Lord protect you.
Written at our Castle of Chinon, XVI. day of July,
1458.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Marie.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>King René had a farm at Rivetes, and from an
inventory dated November 12, 1458, we learn that
he had&mdash;“69 <i>chés d’animaille</i> (heads of stock),
1 <i>jument</i> (mare), 1 <i>poulain</i> (colt), 42 <i>chés de pourceaux</i>
(pigs), and much poultry.” Rivetes, with its
forest of chestnuts, was situated between the rivers
Loire and Anthion, at no great distance from Angers.
René had also wild beasts and birds&mdash;a vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
menagerie at Rivetes and Reculée. His keeper of
lions and leopards in 1476 was Benoist Bagonet,
and of his eagles and peacocks, Vissuel Gosmes. He
had also at Reculée a Court fool, Triboullet. They
were all very pleasant fellows, and helped to amuse
the King and Queen and their guests.</p>

<p>King Charles VII. died at his favourite castle of
Mehun-sur-Yèvre, July 22, 1461. He had suffered
for a considerable time from an incurable ulcer in his
mouth, which denied him the pleasure and necessity
of eating. In his last illness Marie was at Chinon;
he cried piteously for her to come to him: “<i>Marie,
ma Marie!</i>” She hastened to Mehun, and was in
time to hold his hand and moisten his heated brow,
and quietly he died in her arms&mdash;the arms of the
truest of wives and noblest of queens. Charles was
buried in the royal vaults at St. Denis, and
Louis XI., his son, reigned in his stead. Devoted
to his mother, her widowhood was lightened by his
affectionate regard. His father’s death made no
difference in her royal state; the King placed his
mother before his wife&mdash;Charlotte of Savoy.</p>

<p>Queen Marie bore her consort twelve children;
six died in infancy. Her two sons were Louis and
Charles; her daughters, who survived, Catherine,
Jeanne, Yolande, and Madeleine. She survived
Charles but two short years. Enguerrand de
Monstrelet speaks thus of her death, which occurred
near Poitiers, November 23, 1463: “There passed
away from this world Marie of Anjou and France.…
She bore all through her life the character of a
good and devout woman, ever generous and patient.”
Her death was not unexpected, for through trouble,
sorrow, and fasting, her frame had become emaciated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and her pulse beat slow; she died actually from
prostration. Her end was very peaceful in the
silent cloisters of the Abbey of Chastilliers in Poitou.
She had but just returned from a pilgrimage to
the Gallician shrine of Santiago da Compostella.
Her body was embalmed and translated in solemn
guise to St. Denis, and laid beside that of her
husband. Her devotion to him had not ceased at
his death, for she had endowed twelve altars in the
chief cities of France proper for the offering of
Masses for the repose of his soul. Every month she
made the practice of visiting the royal tomb at St.
Denis to hear Mass and pray for him. At Bourges,
of sad and chastened memory, the widowed Queen
founded in honour of her consort three considerable
benevolent institutions&mdash;a hospital for the sick poor,
a refuge for poor pilgrims, and an orphanage for
illegitimate children.</p>

<p>Queen Marie’s transparent faithfulness and absolute
unselfishness is outlined in a famous saying of hers
with respect to her relations with King Charles:
“He is my lord and master; he has entire power
over all my actions, and I have none over his.” Her
whole-hearted devotion and her heroic courage have
raised Marie d’Anjou far above the ordinary level of
her sex, and have elevated her to the very highest
throne among the Queens of France.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">GIOVANNA II. DA NAPOLI&mdash;“SI COMME A REGINA
GIOVANNA!”</span></h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>“Like Queen Giovanna” was, alas! a common saying
in the Two Sicilies what time Giovanna II. was Queen
of Naples. A term of immeasurable reprobation, it
implied the stripping of the woman of every shred of
moral character, the baring of the Queen of every
claim to honour. If Isabeau of Bavaria was the
worst Queen-consort, then Giovanna II. was the
worst Queen-regnant, perhaps, the world has ever
seen. Her story needs telling truthfully with care.</p>

<p>Giovanna II., Queen of Naples, was the only surviving
daughter of Charles III., “<i>Carlo della
Pace</i>,” King of Naples and Count of Provence. Her
mother was Margaret, daughter of her great-uncle
Charles, Duke of Durazzo; hence her parents were
cousins, and were both in the direct line of succession
from Charles I., Count of Anjou, the fourth son of
King Louis IX.,&mdash;St. Louis of France,&mdash;who had
married Beatrix, Countess of Provence in her own
right. Giovanna had seven brothers and sisters, all
of whom died in infancy except Ladislaus, born in
1376; she was his senior by five years, having first
seen the light of day on April 27, 1371.</p>

</div>

<p>The Queen’s father’s predecessor as occupant of
the throne of Naples had been his second cousin,
Giovanna I., the eldest surviving grandchild of King
Robert, “<i>Roberto il Buono e Saggio</i>.” She died
childless in 1382, altho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>ugh twice married, first to
Andrew, King of Hungary, and secondly to Lodovico,
Prince of Taranto. By her will she purposely passed
over the Princes of the Durazzo family, and named as
her successor Louis II. d’Anjou, King of Sicily and
Jerusalem and Count of Provence. The Queen’s
first marriage was celebrated September 24, 1333,
when she was only seven years old, her boy-husband
being fifteen. The Pope created Prince Andrew
King of Naples six years later, upon his succession to
the throne of Hungary. Without the slightest compunction,
Charles, son of Lodovico, Count of Gravina,
seized his cousin’s empty throne, and maintained himself
thereupon for five years, his little daughter Giovanna
being just ten years of age. The death of
Queen Giovanna I. was due to the instigation of
Charles. He entered Naples at the head of a strong
force of cavalry, seized the palace, and took the
Queen prisoner. She was conducted to the Castle of
Muro, overlooking the road from Naples to Melfi,
and there, with her lover, Otto of Brunswick, suffocated
under a feather bed by two Hungarian soldiers.
This outrage was committed in revenge for the death
of King Andrew, which was ordered by Giovanna I.,
his consort.</p>

<p>Charles III., King of Naples, died in 1386, leaving
to his son Ladislaus the royal succession, with his
widow, Queen Margaret, as Regent. They with the
Princess Giovanna, sixteen years of age, were fugitives
from castle to castle, pursued by the troops of Louis
d’Anjou. Nevertheless, Margaret was an astute
mother, for when Ladislaus was eighteen years old
she espoused him to Constance, daughter of the Count
of Clermont in Sicily, a very wealthy heiress. What
matrimonial projects were hatched or addled on behalf
of Princess Giovanna during her father’s lifetime we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
know not, but almost the first matter taken in hand
by King Ladislaus was an advantageous marriage for
his sister. This was a very complicated business.
First of all, neither he nor she cared very much for
matrimony; he was a libertine, and she shared his
freedom and his depravity. Next, each suitor for the
hand of Giovanna retired disgusted by the loose
morals of the Neapolitan Court and by the avarice of
the King and his sister. However, at length a match
was arranged between the Princess and Prince
William, son of Leopold III., Duke of Austria. The
actual nuptials, however, were postponed for one
reason or another until 1403, when Giovanna had
reached the considerable age of thirty-two. The
princely couple went off to Austria, where they
remained more or less unhappy until 1406, when the
Prince died suddenly and suspiciously, many said by
the hand or direction of his ill-conditioned wife.</p>

<p>The widow returned at once to Naples to fill the
place of honour vacated by her brother’s wife, his
second consort, Maria di Lusignan. Queen Constance
he had divorced in 1391, and married the daughter
of the King of Cyprus the same year. The ostensible
reason for rejecting Constance was the failure of her
father to pay her dowry. She was a lovely girl and
virtuous,&mdash;a rare quality at that time,&mdash;and became
the idol of the Court. Queen Maria had scarcely
been seated on the throne, when she also fell from her
high station. Ladislaus said she was delicate and in
consumption, and no wife for him. One day, when
she and the King were assisting at Mass in the
cathedral, she heard with the utmost astonishment
and dismay the Archbishop read a Bull of Pope
Boniface IX. annulling her marriage with Ladislaus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
At the conclusion of the citation the prelate advanced
to the Queen’s throne and demanded her wedding-ring.
Too stupefied to resist, the pledge of her
married state was torn from her finger, and she was
carried away to a remote convent under the care of
two aged nuns. Three years after this outrage the
King relented of his cruelty, and married her to one
Andrea di Capua, one of his favourites. He took a
third wife in 1406, Marie d’Enghien, the widow of
Raimondo d’Orsini, some six months after the return
of his sister from Austria. She is said to have survived
Ladislaus. Some letters of hers are preserved
at Conversano, near Bari, in the Benedictine convent.</p>

<p>The advance of Louis d’Anjou upon the capital
roused Ladislaus to action, and he hastily gathered
together an undisciplined army, and set forth to
withstand his rival to the throne. A decisive battle
was fought at Rocca Secca, May 19, 1411, wherein
Ladislaus’s troops were routed, but Louis failed to
follow up his advantage, and Ladislaus retained his
throne and continued his debauches.</p>

<p>Early in 1412 Queen Margaret, mother of the
King and of Giovanna, died somewhat suddenly.
She and her entourage had taken refuge from a
visitation of plague, which spared neither prince nor
peasant, at her villa at Acquamela, six miles from
Salerno. She was buried privately in the Cathedral
of Salerno, in the crypt over against the marble
sarcophagus which contained the ashes of St.
Matthew. Whatever influence she may have exerted
during the youth of her son and daughter for their
good was speedily dissipated, and as soon as Ladislaus
had obtained the crown he took steps to circumscribe
the liberty of his mother. She appealed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
her daughter Giovanna for sympathy, but found
none, and the poor old Queen, who had survived her
consort, Charles, for six-and-twenty years, was
consigned to the Convent of the Annunciation, “so
as to be out of the way of mischief,” as her daughter
phrased it. The natural rôle of mother was entirely
out of place in a palace or at a Court ruled by a
libertine and a prostitute.</p>

<p>Ladislaus died sadly and alone. His unnatural
sister refused to be with him, and all his butterfly
courtesans gave to themselves wing when sickness
and death entered the royal palace. He died
August 6, 1414, leaving no lawful offspring by his
three wives, but a numerous family of natural children.
No Salic Law governed the succession to the throne
in the kingdom of Naples, consequently Giovanna
became Queen.</p>

<p>The widowed Queen Giovanna had not married
again, although she counted lovers by the score;
but within a few months of her accession she took
steps to ally herself with a Prince who should be
the handsomest and wittiest of the time. This
determination of Giovanna was noised abroad all over
the capitals and Courts of Europe, and forthwith a
troop of eligible suitors passed through the ports
of Marseilles and Genoa, each bent on taking the
ribald Queen at her word. The romance reads like
a fairy tale, for each princeling and prince was put
through his paces to show his qualifications in person
and in purse; for, desperately wicked as she was, the
Queen had a commercial sense, and her exchequer
stood sorely in need of replenishment. Taken for all
in all, Juan d’Arragona, son of King Ferdinand, was
the champion of physical beauty, knightly courtesy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and financial competence; but he was no more than
a precocious lad of seventeen, whilst the Queen was
forty-five. A matrimonial union was ruled to be
impossible, and the pride of Aragon would not suffer
a scion of her royal house to become the plaything
of a lewd Queen.</p>

<p>Giovanna very unwillingly transferred her affections
to an older suitor,&mdash;the champion, if we may
so write, of the heavy weights,&mdash;Jacques de Bourbon,
Comte de la Marche, of the Royal House of France,
and their nuptials were celebrated in the Cathedral
of Naples on August 10, 1415. He very soon
discovered that, strong man as he was, he had a
wily woman to contend with. He began to assert
his marital rights, and required Giovanna to accord
him equal honours with herself; at the same time he
utterly failed in the reformation of the conduct of
his wife. She served herself upon him as she willed,
but she mostly willed to serve him not at all, and
to transfer her favours, as before their marriage,
indiscriminately to whilom paramours. Like a lion
wounded in his den, Roy Jacques,&mdash;for so he called
himself,&mdash;struck out at his supplanters, and, with his
past-master knowledge of the rapier and its uses, he
pricked to death not one but many lovers of the
Queen. The Neapolitans were man for man with
Giovanna, and indignant with her consort. Strange
to say, perhaps, for us who read the story of the
time, evil royal communications had wholly corrupted
the morals and the manners of all classes in the
realm.</p>

<p>Incited by toadies and sycophants, Giovanna at
last took the upper hand against her spouse, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>on
September 13, 1416,&mdash;little more than a year after
their marriage,&mdash;she ordered his imprisonment in
the Castella dell’ Ovo, a fortress of such strength that
Froissart said: “None but the devil can take it!”
Thence, however, he escaped, but with a price upon
his head,&mdash;fixed by his inconstant mistress,&mdash;and
took up his residence at Besançon, with the white
cord of St. Francis d’Assisi round his loins. There
he died, having renounced the world, the flesh, and
the devil, a wiser and a disillusioned man, in 1436.</p>

<p>Giovanna, released from the bonds of matrimony,
greatly to her relief, gave herself unreservedly into
the arms of every man dare-devil enough to risk the
consequences. Of these, perhaps the first whose
name and maldoings chroniclers have preserved was
Pandolfo Alopo, a base-born athlete, a very handsome
fellow, and a seductive guitarist to boot. He
responded to his royal mistress’s amours, and she
appointed him Seneschal of the kingdom, with
authority to use her signet-ring. Very soon, mentally
and morally undisciplined as he was, he exceeded the
length of Giovanna’s tether, by exciting her jealousy
with respect to her Maids of Honour. Short was his
shrift. Seized, bound, and tortured with nameless
indignity and cruelty, his mutilated body was cast
into the sea off the fair island of Nisida, where the
vicious vixen held orgies equal in atrocity and
bestiality to those of Tiberius in Capri.</p>

<p>Sforza da Colignola stepped gaily in the bloody
footmarks of Alopo. He was the chief of the
Queen’s pages, and had been reared under her eye
and at her will; he had, moreover, a fell influence
over his mistress, as witness time out of mind, ever
since his teens, of her enormities. He, indeed,
gained the upper hand of Giovanna, and, being a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>n
adept in martial exercises, held his own against all
comers. For a time he left the intimate service of
the Queen, and became a soldier of fortune, winning
laurels and prizes all along his way. Secretly he
sympathized with the claims of the House of Anjou,
judging shrewdly enough that under the white lilies
of Louis he would have a better hold upon his
position at the Court of Naples than he would under
the red bars of Alfonso of Aragon.</p>

<p>Giovanna felt the thraldom of Sforza’s strength of
character and his knowledge of her past, and because
no one seemed willing to take her at her word, and
rid her of his presence, she turned herself about and
fixed her confidence on Sergianni Caracciolo. Upon
him she showered riches and honours, but in return
he made himself her master.</p>

<p>The Queen’s choice of favourites was not, however,
confined to men of merit or of high degree. Every
good-looking youth or well-favoured man upon whom
her eyes chanced to rest was enrolled in her household.
She frequented athletic meetings incognita to
view the personal qualifications of vigorous youths,
and spent her evenings in surreptitious visits to her
stables and her kennels. The men of her choice
were offered no alternative, but when the guilty
intercourse was consummated the lucky-luckless
companion of her couch was expected to commit
suicide or for ever leave his home on pain of
imprisonment and torture if he tarried four-and-twenty
hours.</p>

<p>Perhaps no figure of a man fascinated Queen
Giovanna more completely than did the handsome
person of Bartolommeo Colleone of Bergamo. Hi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>s
family had become impoverished by the bitter feuds of
the Guelphs and Ghibellines, so at eighteen the young
lad bid his parents farewell and started off to win his
way in military adventures. He travelled south to
Naples, and at twenty was as lusty and as strong
as any man he met. Of a strict habit of body, he
performed feats none others dared. Giovanna sent
for the good-looking stranger, and pitted him against
the ablest youths of Naples. In leaping, running,
and casting of heavy weights, no one could surpass
him. Instantly the Queen fell in love with him, and
appointed him her esquire, with ready access to her
boudoir, where she denied him nothing. His final
reward was the cloister of St. Francis d’Assisi,
which became his prison, and his mouth was sealed.
How he escaped torture no one has recorded.</p>

<p>It would be long, and certainly distasteful, to give
a full list of all those who shared the vampire caresses
of the peccant Queen; but brief is her story of how
Giovanna destroyed the fair fame of her house and
the honour of her country. Of her it was written:
“<i>Ultima Durazza fiet destructio regnum</i>” (“The last
Durazzo shall destroy the kingdom”).</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Whilst Giovanna was thus prostituting herself and
her kingdom, and Alfonso of Aragon was biding his
time, a movement was on foot in Anjou and Provence,
under the strong hand of Queen Yolande, to win back
the rights her husband had abandoned to the succession
of the Neapolitan crown. Her eldest son,&mdash;a
boy not yet out of school,&mdash;should place that crown
once more upon the head of an Angevine Sovereign
or perish in the attempt. Men and arms and allies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
were all requisitioned, and elaborate preparations were
made at Marseilles and Genoa for the embarkation of
the “army of Naples.”</p>

<p>The expedition of Louis III. to Naples was hurried
forward in consequence of the breach between Queen
Giovanna and the nobles of Naples. Her disregard
of their allegiance, and her appointment to all the
more important posts under the Crown of men of
obscure origin who had commended themselves to her
by their physical charms and coarse obscenities, caused
a disruption in the political economy of the kingdom.
The Queen was deaf to the expostulations of her
Barons, and ordered them severally to their estates,
where, fuming with indignation, they armed their
retainers and stood ready for any emergency. The
arrogance of King Alfonso drove many would-be
adherents into the camp of his Angevine rival, and
an influential deputation of aggrieved dignitaries made
its way to Marseilles to tender to Yolande, the Queen
of Sicily and the mother of Anjou, their homage, and
to assure her of their cordial support for the youthful
King if only she would permit him to show himself at
the head of an overawing force before the capital.</p>

<p>There is a romantic story concerning King Louis’s
journey to Naples told by Jehan Charantais, esquire
to the King, in a letter to Queen Yolande. The
fleet of Genoese and Provençal galleons was driven by
adverse winds, it is related, and sought refuge under
the high cliffs of Sicily. Whilst weather-bound, the
young Prince landed with a company of knights in
search of adventures. As they came ashore a number
of girls greeted them with showers of roses, and tossed
them handfuls of kisses. One, more daring than the
rest, ran up to the youthful Sovereign, wholly ignora<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>nt
of his identity, and gave him a nosegay of crimson
blooms tied with a lovers’ knot of blue ribbon.
Accepting the good-omened offering, Louis loosened
his surcoat to insert the fragrant spray, when his
kingly medallion fell out at the foot of the damsel.
She at once picked it up and ran away, laughing
provokingly. The Prince followed her, caught her,
recovered his badge of sovereignty, and gave his
captive in exchange a sounding kiss. But Leonora,&mdash;such
was her name,&mdash;had discovered who he was.</p>

<p>That same day a missive was brought aboard the
flagship by a Sicilian fisherman. It was in Leonora’s
handwriting, and bore her signature. She told him
she was about to be sent to Naples by her parents as
a Maid of Honour to the Queen. She had very
much disliked the idea, and had refused to go, because
Giovanna was the daughter of a usurper, as was
reported, and because she bore so evil a character.
“Now,” she added, “that I have seen and spoken to
<i>my</i> King, and have received his embraces, I am ready
to go at all hazards and do my utmost in his cause.”</p>

<p>Louis dillydallied with his Sicilian mermaid, and
their loves continued for wellnigh a fortnight before
his fleet was ready to put to sea again. Fair Leonora,
too, took her departure, saying, as she bid adieu to
her lover: “We shall meet, dear Prince, again in the
Queen’s boudoir.”</p>

</div>

<p>Louis III., a well-grown lad of seventeen, and as
manly as he was fit mentally, arrived off the city of
Naples on August 15, 1420, to maintain his right to
the throne more bravely and more successfully than
either his father or his grandfather had done. He
had just fallen in with the fleet of the King of
Aragon, but in defeating his hereditary enemy his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
own flotilla was so greatly worsted that he was unable
to take the city by storm. He landed, however, and
betook himself to Aversa to present his homage to
Queen Giovanna. Shocked by her lustful overtures,
he departed precipitately to Rome, and there bided
his time. The Queen’s failure to seduce the young
Sovereign threw her once more into the arms of
King Alfonso, whom she formally proclaimed her heir
on September 24 the same year. Three years
passed whilst the adherents of the House of Anjou
suffered forfeiture of goods, liberty of person, and
many cruel punishments and tortures.</p>

<p>Alfonso, a natural son of King Ferdinand the Just,
King of Aragon and Sicily, was forty years of age,
remarkably handsome, talented and capable, ambitious,
but generous and devoted to the fair sex. He was,
however, entirely unresponsive to the amorous approaches
of the Queen. His rejection, his scorn, and
his independence of action, roused in Giovanna keen
feelings of resentment. She had named him heir to
Naples; she could just as easily disinherit and discard
him. On June 24, 1423,&mdash;good St. John the
Baptist’s Day, a festival of major obligation in the
Church,&mdash;the Queen caused proclamation to be made
at Mass and in the markets that, “owing to the
incompetence and pretensions of the King of Aragon,
he is thereby disinherited, and is no longer to be
recognized as successor to the throne of Naples.” A
plot, indeed, or more correctly plots, were revealed
to Giovanna whereby Alfonso was implicated in a
conspiracy to seize the Queen’s person, imprison her,
and ultimately to poison her. On May 22 of the
same year he had taken the bold step of arresting
Gianni Caracciolo, the Queen’s chief favourite. Thi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>s
roused Giovanna to action. She ordered Caracciolo’s
immediate release, and bade Alfonso quit Naples at
once, or remain at his peril. Greatly to her surprise
and relief, he took his departure, and left the field
open to his youthful rival.</p>

<p>The Queen’s next step was to send to Rome, and
invite her “beloved cousin,” as she called Louis, to
return to her assistance in driving the Aragonese out
of Naples, and to accept the succession to her throne.
She bade him to have no fear of misunderstandings
of the past, but to regard herself as nothing more
than a well-intentioned relative.</p>

<p>Louis, now grown to manhood, with ripened
experience of warlike tactics and political strife, and,
be it said, of women and their ways, entered Naples
in state on April 10, 1424. His arrival in Southern
Italy cheered the desponding spirits of the Angevine
party and roused their zeal. Adherents flocked to
the banner he set up, and men and arms were ready
at his beck and call. A very important personage
allied himself with the young King-adventurer&mdash;none
other than Sforza, the famous <i>condottiere</i>.
He gathered around him a considerable number of
distinguished malcontents and disappointed favourites
of the Queen, who in no way concealed their intention
of revenging the insults she had heaped upon
them, as soon as they gained a promising opportunity.
News of this determination very soon reached
Giovanna’s ears, and she shut herself up in her
palace with her maidens and her toadies, and declined
to receive King Louis or his envoys. At the same
time she summoned to her presence Braccio Fortebraccio
di Mantova, another of her renowned <i>condottieri</i>,
and Constable of Sicily, the avowed rival an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>d
enemy of Sforza, and suffering under a decree of
excommunication of Pope Martin V.</p>

<p>Leonora, immediately in attendance on the Queen,
managed very skilfully to convey intelligence of all
that passed in Giovanna’s secret councils to her royal
lover. She told him that, in spite of her recent
proclamation, the Queen had sent her favourite
Court Seneschal, Gianni Caracciolo, to the King of
Aragon to implore him to come and rescue her, and
put the coalition to flight. She asked Alfonso to
accept the title and estates of Duke of Calabria, as
appertaining to the heir-presumptive to the Neapolitan
throne. This daring courtier pressed his attentions
upon the Queen, demanding not only a share of her
bed, but a share of her throne. Leonora told Louis
all the ins and outs of this intrigue, and warned him
to be on the alert; for should Caracciolo’s presumption
become known in Naples, there would be a
general revolution. Sforza, on his side, was not
prepared to allow his rival Hercules an unquestioned
victory at Court. He demanded admission to the
palace, and an interview with the Queen, before
whom he challenged Caracciolo to mortal combat.</p>

<p>Giovanna was delighted that such redoubtable
champions should worst each other on her account.
Her vanity was flattered&mdash;and that is a happy condition
for a scheming woman. Undoubtedly she most
favoured Caracciolo, but Sforza’s fine physique
appealed to her irresistibly, and she fanned his
passion. If Caracciolo was for the moment master
of her heart, Sforza was master of her future, and
she was happy. One day she invited the rivals to
join her in the chase, and she rode between them.
She cared little for hunting save as an incenti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>ve to
amorous relations. Tiring soon of the exercise,
she expressed a wish to dismount and saunter in
the forest glades, but her mood lead to an extraordinary
contest. Caracciolo threw himself at once
off his mount, and gave the Queen his hand to rid
her of her pommel. Sforza, seeing his advantage,
pressed his horse against the Queen’s and seized her
other hand. Each hero pulled his hardest, until
Giovanna was compelled to cry aloud for pain!
Then, slipping quietly down, she ordered Sforza to
release her. This token of non-preference excited the
<i>condottiere’s</i> passion. “If Caracciolo,” he hissed
out, “had not been so clumsy, your Majesty would
not have been so greatly disarranged!”</p>

<p>“It is not you,” replied the Queen, “that should
dare to regulate my conduct, or, for the matter of
that, your rival’s. Hold your tongue and leave me;
your presence is not grateful just now!”</p>

<p>“As you will, madam,” said Sforza fiercely.
“Yes, I will leave you with the favourite of your
heart, but you ought to know that you cannot treat
thus a man like me!” Then he turned to Caracciolo,
and exclaimed in a tone of scornful disdain: “As
for you, I advise you to use all your wits and all
your resources, for you will stand in need of them!”</p>

<p>Giovanna was on that day absolutely overcome
by her physical passions. She cared for nothing,
and the last sight the enraged Sforza had of her was
locked in her lover’s arms and reclining on a mossy
bed, lost to the world around. The erring Queen
speedily came to her senses with respect to the position
Sforza had taken up; and when she learnt that
he had thrown in his lot for better or for worse with
Louis III., under a pretext, she despatched Caraccio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>lo
to Rome to claim the Papal reversal of his excommunication,
and to assure the Pope of her filial
devotion to the Holy See. Before he departed,
Giovanna required him to deliver up his sword as
Seneschal of the kingdom, which she promptly offered
as a bribe to Sforza.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Leonora had not been idle. She had
spoken to the Queen often and passionately about
the comeliness and the gallantry of her hero, contrasting
his buoyant physical excellences with the
blazé proportions of Alfonso,&mdash;not knowing that he
had rejected Giovanna’s lustful overtures,&mdash;until
she expressed herself desirous of confirming his
appointment as her heir. Leonora wrote thus to
King Louis: “Come not yet to the palace; but
arm your fleet, and recruit what troops you can.
Sforza is loyal, but Caracciolo is your enemy, and he
is powerful. Besides him you have to reckon with
Braccio and with King Alfonso. You have need
of prudence and daring.”</p>

<p>The position of affairs, so far as the Queen was
personally concerned, was perilous in the extreme.
On one hand, the King of Aragon did not hide his
intention of capturing her, and consigning her and
her maidens and men to a castle in Catalonia, and
then he would be absolute master of the kingdom of
Naples. On the other hand, Louis, aided by Sforza,
whom she had so grievously outraged, was determined
to win back his ancestral inheritance, Queen or no
Queen, but he in no way threatened her life or
liberty. The Queen fled with her Court to the
Castle of Capua, and there established herself. Sforza
followed her, and, whilst avowedly protecting his
Queen, made her his prisoner, and then, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
assistance of the fleet of King Louis, caused Alfonso,
who with Braccio was investing the city of Naples,
to seek refuge in Castel Nuovo, whence he set sail to
Aragon for reinforcements and supplies.</p>

<p>Leonora,&mdash;still with the Queen and still devoted
to the cause of King Louis,&mdash;wrote to him again,
bidding him adventure himself to Aversa, whither
Giovanna retired after the departure of King Alfonso.
There Louis found her, and, in spite of advancing
years and the disordered life she had led, noted her
good looks, her grace of manner and of speech, and her
general attractiveness. “Her eyes,” wrote Leonora,
“flashed wonderfully, and her cheeks reddened passionately
directly she beheld again her good-looking
young cousin.” Giovanna greeted him at the top of
the grand staircase of the palace, and addressed him
in gushing terms: “The brave deeds you have
accomplished, gallant Prince,” she said, “have added
greatly to your renown. Enter, victorious King, my
peaceful abode, take a well-merited repose, and receive
from me, your devoted admirer, the homage of a
thankful Princess, who is greatly charmed at beholding
you in full possession of your lawful estate.”
Extending her hand, she led the young King to the
apartments which had been prepared for him.</p>

<p>Louis, bowing profoundly, deprecated the services
which had gained such honours as the Queen had
bestowed upon him. “I have achieved success in
your name, Madam, and for your pleasure,” he replied.
They supped together, and then, bidding all the
company and the servants to withdraw, she conversed
with her visitor upon every subject that came uppermost
in her mind, but eventually laid herself open
to receive the supreme pleasure she had in con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>templation.
Louis was inflexible, and all her tenderness
and affection found no response. At last she said:
“I do not know what more I can do. You, Sire,
accept gladly the rights your arms have won, but
what is more precious still you refuse&mdash;these arms
of mine which are ready to do your will and
pleasure.”</p>

<p>Giovanna then lowered her gaze and sat mute,
awaiting Louis’s reply with palpitating breast. She
might very well have hummed the kissing song of
Ronsard:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“On soit d’un baiser sec, ou d’un baiser humide,</div>
<div class="verse">D’un baiser court, ou d’un baiser qui guide</div>
<div class="verse">L’âme dessuz la bouche, et laisse tréspasser</div>
<div class="verse">Le baiseur.”</div>
<div class="english">
<div class="verse">“Maybe the kiss is cold, maybe it’s warm;</div>
<div class="verse">A kiss and off, or a kiss that clings,</div>
<div class="verse">And guides the ardent lover ’neath the lips</div>
<div class="verse">Till he finds no way to escape.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“No, madam,” at last spoke the young Prince,
greatly embarrassed by the Queen’s words and
looks, “it shall never be said that I seek the means
for impairing your royal prerogative; you shall retain
that, I pray, in its entirety so long as Providence
sees good to preserve you to your people.” Then he
politely withdrew from the chamber and sought his
own lodging. Again on the morrow the King and
Queen dined together privately. Giovanna was
dressed superbly in royal robes and wore priceless
jewels, but her manner was strangely marked by
languor and vexation. Their conversation was forced
and restrained in turn. After the repast they
adjourned together to the lovely gardens of the
palace, which were brilliantly illuminated and filled
with a numerous and festive company. The best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
musicians, of the capital and the most excellent
jongleurs of foreign and native fame forgathered
to do honour to the royal guest. Dances and flirtations
were the order of the evening, and among the
Queen’s maidens was the lovely girl from Sicily,
Leonora. Louis saw her immediately, and it was
not very long before they were <i>tête-à-tête</i> in a grotto
hidden from public gaze.</p>

<p>The royal romance reached a climax when Louis
avowed himself the devoted admirer and lover of the
girl. He even proposed a clandestine marriage, but
Leonora begged him with tears not to press his suit.
She revealed to him the real character of her mistress,
and warned him that if Giovanna became conversant
with the liaison, then she herself would be done
to death, and he, Louis, would probably be assassinated.
“You may,” she said, “refuse to marry
the Queen, but she will never pardon you if you
marry anybody else.”</p>

<p>Again, the third day of Louis’s visit to Aversa,
the Queen arranged meals and meetings alone with
the Prince, whose morals and whose manhood she
was striving so consumedly to seduce. The Queen’s
eyes had in them not alone the lure of lust, but the
flash of passion and the flame of resentment. Louis
again excused himself her presence, and, making his
way to his tryst with Leonora, heard as he approached
the grotto the high-toned voice of Giovanna beating
down the frightened protests of his <i>innamorata</i>&mdash;they
were together in the grotto! The Prince
revealed himself, only to meet the scornful invectives
of the jealous Queen. She demanded to know the
nature of Louis’s relations with her serving-maid,
and when she had heard the story she turned upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Leonora like a tiger. Louis stepped before the
terrified girl, and bade Giovanna abate her fury and
not lay hands upon a woman whom he loved.
“Leonora has done more than you, madam,” he exclaimed,
“to mount me on the throne of Naples,
and you shall not cause me to descend therefrom!”</p>

<p>The Queen, at last realizing the manner of man
with whom she had to deal, was intimidated by his
boldness, and presently she left the grotto. Leonora
still refused Louis’s proposition, and before the day
dawned she had taken her flight from Aversa, and
was well on her way to Rome, to claim sanctuary.
She wrote a farewell letter to her royal lover, which
a faithful dependent of her father safely conveyed
to Naples. King Louis offered the old man every
possible inducement to reveal the hiding-place of his
young mistress, but he never broke the seal of secrecy
which Leonora placed upon him, and Louis and
Leonora never met again.</p>

<p>Louis managed to evade the embraces and the
advances of the Queen. He had been espoused to
the Princess Margaret of Savoy, and although he
used the liberty of a vigorous and a level-headed
young manhood under the silver-feathered ægis of
Prince Cupid, he was not forgetful of his troth.
Having broken the back of the opposition of Alfonso
of Aragon, and being confident of the support of
Genoa and Milan, he lived in comparative comfort
and peace; but he withdrew into Calabria, where he
was for a time, at all events, safe from the intrigues
of Giovanna. During this interval the young King
made repeated visits both to Angers and Chambéry,
to greet his devoted mother, revive the sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
memories of his boyhood, and to cultivate the love
of his fiancée Margaret, now growing rapidly to
womanhood.</p>

<p>The whole of France was once again in a ferment.
The English, driving all before them, captured almost
all the possessions of the Crown. Charles VII. was
a fugitive, and his consort Marie, Louis’s beloved
sister, broken-hearted. René, his younger brother,
was fighting for his own in Bar and Lorraine. With
the chivalry and self-sacrifice which distinguished all
the children of Louis II. and Yolande, he placed his
sword at the disposal of his brother-in-law, and fell
into line with the defenders of his native soil. None
of the French King’s allies held themselves more
stoutly, nor were anything like so dependable, as was
the young King of Sicily and Naples. His royal
person and his coroneted helmet were ever foremost
in the battle; his bravery was inspiring. When
matters seemed to be hopeless and the flame of
France’s honour appeared to be extinguished, the
miraculous mission of the Maid of Domremy cheered
the hearts of all true patriots. She chose René as her
<i>preux chevalier</i>, and her place was at the head of the
troops under his orders. Louis III. had another
post of danger to fill; he and his command were
told off to keep watchful eyes upon the movements of
the Duke of Burgundy. By his excellent strategy
he kept the English apart from their allies, and
rendered the co-operation of the Burgundians impossible.</p>

<p>The relief of Orléans was followed by the amalgamation
of the two French armies, led so brilliantly
by the Angevine royal brothers, and the victorious
hosts of France swept Charles and his Court along
with them triumphantly to his <i>Sacré</i> at Reims.
Released from his duties as coadjutor to the King
of France, Louis returned south again, and at Geneva
he and Margherita di Savoia were united in the
bonds of matrimony. The royal couple left immediately
for Marseilles, and sailed away to Naples,
accompanied by a strong squadron of war-galleys of
Venice and Genoa; for the Venetians, recognizing the
courage and the ability of the young King, and
desirous of gaining some of the commercial profits
of Neapolitan trade, joined their forces to the banner
of the Angevine King of Naples.</p>

<p>Once more in his capital he discovered Queen
Giovanna wholly under the influence of Gianni
Caracciolo, who had assumed regal attributes, and
was personally carrying on an intrigue to supplant
his authority. Louis immediately sent for the
usurper, asked him about his pretensions, and warned
him that if the Queen, as he said, had named him
her Lieutenant-General, he (Louis) was his undoubted
Sovereign. Caracciolo took the King’s assumption
of his kingly rights quite nonchalantly, and replied
insolently that as long as Giovanna lived he was the
mouthpiece of her Government.</p>

<p>The favourite of the Queen was not a <i>persona
grata</i> at her Court. His arrogance and presumption
raised up enemies on every side; in particular, the
old nobility looked askance upon a courtier of his low
origin. Sergianni was by name a Caracciolo, by birth
the son of a common woman&mdash;so it was said. The
Queen’s Mistress of the Robes was Covella Ruffo,
Duchess of Sessa,&mdash;her husband was a pretender to
the crown,&mdash;and she voiced the palace discontent.
She boldly demanded of Giovanna the immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
disgrace of her Seneschal, and proclaimed the Court
preference for King Louis and his fascinating consort
Margherita. The Queen indignantly stood by
Caracciolo, and forbade the Duchess to name the
matter again. Within ten days,&mdash;it was August 25,
1432,&mdash;the body of the favourite was picked up by
brethren of the Misericordia and given decent burial.
In the dead man’s heart, plunged up to the hilt, was
the jewelled poniard of the Duchess of Sessa! The
incident passed, for the Queen deemed it inexpedient
to ask for explanations; besides, she had become
wearied by the obsequiousness of her Minister, and
she had other fish to fry! With rare commercial
acumen, she seized all Caracciolo’s belongings,&mdash;most
of them he had received from herself,&mdash;and actually,
with feminine inconsequence, shared them with the
Duchess!</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Whilst Louis was strengthening his position at
Naples, Duke René of Bar and Lorraine was
languishing in the Tour de Bar at Bracon, vanquished
at Bulgneville and crushed by the Duke of
Burgundy. Louis added his protest against his
brother’s retention in captivity to that of all the
Sovereigns and peers of France, and his appeal was
carried by Queen Margherita to her father, the Duke
of Savoy, whose influence was great with the Court
of Burgundy. René’s release on parole for a year
was largely due to the intercession of his brother.
Giovanna expressed a wish to see “my other cousin
of Anjou,” as she put it, and Louis pressed his
brother to bend his steps to Naples and recruit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
his health and spirits in the sunny, merry South.
The Duke’s first step, however, was to hurry off to
Nancy to fold his heroic wife Isabelle and darling
children to his breast; here, too, to regulate many
affairs of State awaiting his decision. To Angers
next he boated, to pay his filial homage to his
courageous, resourceful mother, Queen Yolande, and
to relieve her of some of the worry of government.
René, too, had much business to do at the Court of
King Charles of France, and his loyal, devoted subjects
in Provence demanded his presence. So passed nearly
the whole of his twelvemonth’s grace.</p>

<p>Giovanna’s reception of her “cousin” was affectionate
in the extreme, and she was warm in her
admiration of “another handsome Prince of Anjou.”</p>

<p>Nothing, however, would suit her until René became
her guest, and as such he went through all the weird
experience of his elder brother. It mattered not to the
Queen that he was a married man with a loving wife
and dear children; what mattered to her was that he
was good-looking, brave, and gallant. To be sure,
René’s serious manner disconcerted her, and his
artistic tastes bored her, but under his studious
courtesy she tried to believe that he was hiding a
lively response to her amorous advances. In the
presence of “<i>il galantuomo Re</i>,”&mdash;by which term she
always saluted Louis,&mdash;Giovanna named René second
heir to her kingdom, and successor to the title and
estates of the duchy of Calabria. She carefully
refrained from inquiries about Duchess Isabelle;
indeed, she ignored her existence altogether, and in
this line of conduct she was quite consistent, for she
had declined to receive the young Queen Margherita
when Louis entered Naples with her in state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>René, however, was instrumental, whilst under
the fascination of Queen Giovanna, in effecting two
matters of importance for the kingdom of Naples
and its people. She had instructed Giovanni
Capistrani, a perfervid son of Rome, and at the same
time an admirer of the Queen, whom she had
appointed Court Chamberlain, to persecute the Jews
and drive them away from Naples; all such as
refused exile he was ordered to put to death. René
interposed in the interpretation of these decrees, and
gained the Queen’s consent to allow the persecuted
race to remain on two conditions: (1) That they
should not exact unjust usury; and (2) that they
should be marked by a yellow cross to differentiate
them from the Christian subjects of the Crown.
René further suggested to Giovanna that the Church
needed her patronage, that she herself would go the
way of all flesh, and that some accommodation with
Heaven was very desirable. The Queen laughed his
counsel to scorn, and badgered him for a crusader
and a churchling, but his words went home
even to her hardened, sensuous heart. Capistrani’s
unexpected action, moreover, greatly moved her; he
resigned his Court offices and emoluments, and
meekly entered a monastery of St. Francis d’Assisi.</p>

<p>Duke René returned to his prison at Dijon, and
King Louis took his bride off to Cosenza, the capital
of Calabria, where a second marriage was celebrated
on August 15, 1433, to allay the scruples of prejudiced
adherents of the Neapolitan throne. A rumour
had been spread,&mdash;originating, it was said, with the
Queen herself,&mdash;which affirmed that Margherita was
not the wife, but the mistress, of the royal Duke!
Eighteen short months of marital bliss were enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
by Louis and Margherita, broken, alas! by a fresh
attack by Alfonso in force on Naples. A naval
battle off Gaeta, 1434, ended disastrously for the
fleet of Aragon. Arrayed against it were the allied
forces of Genoa, Venice, Florence, and Milan.
Alfonso and his brother Juan were taken prisoners,
and carried off to Milan by Duke Filippo Maria.
Then a blow fell on the young Queen and upon the
whole kingdom of Naples, which made itself felt
even in the morbid heart of Queen Giovanna. King
Louis caught fever besieging the city of Taranto,
and was borne swiftly off to Cosenza, where he
died, in his own fond Queen’s arms, on November
15, 1434. Few Princes have made themselves so
universally loved as Louis III. of Sicily and Naples,
and never were there so many sad hearts and tearful
eyes in the kingdom of Naples as when his beloved
body was laid out for burial in the Cathedral of
Cosenza.</p>

<p>Giovanna never again recovered her spirits; to be
sure, she did not renounce her evil ways, but she set
about in a hurry to put into execution Duke René’s
suggestions. Among belated pious deeds, she rebuilt
and refounded the Church of Santa Maria dell’
Annunziata by way of penance for her bad life, and
there she was buried in front of the high-altar. A
simple slab of marble points out, in the absence of
a grandiose monument, the place of her sepulture.
She died February 2, 1435, and no woman wept for
her, and no man felt grieved. If it is true that “the
evil which men do dies with them,” then we must
not rake up the tainting memories of an evil past.
Giovanna II., Queen of Naples, has passed to her
last account, and before Heaven’s tribunal will s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>he
stand, alongside with the victims of her vampire-love.
Faraglia, in his “<i>Storia della Regina Giovanna
II. d’Angio</i>,” makes a brave attempt to whitewash
the character of the Queen, and he records many
interesting details in her daily life. “Every morning,”
he says, “she rose with the sun, spent one hour
at Mass and private devotions; then she applied
herself to the study of music and literature; at noon
she breakfasted, generally alone, the afternoon she
gave to exercise, and before dinner she bathed in a
bath supplied with the milk of one hundred asses.”
Apparently the Queen gave no time to affairs of
State, and she had not much leisure for company.
Undoubtedly Queen Giovanna was the friend of art
and craft, but only so far as their exponents helped
to enhance her own attractions and luxuries. Antonio
Solario&mdash;“Il Zingaro”&mdash;was her favourite painter,
and, by the oddest of irrational conventions, he has
represented her in an altar-piece as the Virgin Mary
with the Infant Christ, and surrounded by a court of
saints!</p>

<p>With what feelings the news of the death of
Louis III. at Cosenza was received by René in his
prison chamber at Tour de Bar we may well imagine.
The hold of his house upon the kingdom of Naples
was, of course, of the weakest; and if the late King
upon the spot, free to move what troops and stores
he had at will, was unable to retain command of
Naples, how could a captive Prince away in Burgundy
hope to enforce successfully his claim as his brother’s
heir?</p>

<p>In Provence and Anjou and beyond the borders of
his dominions, with Bar and Lorraine, and with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>the
sympathy and assistance of friendly Sovereigns and
Princes at home and abroad, he had, of course,
numberless loyal subjects, friends, and allies, but
among them all not one could enthuse his cause as
he could himself in person. Three devoted Princesses,&mdash;Yolande,
Isabelle, and Marguerite,&mdash;were
doing all they could to free him from his captivity.
Their efforts were in the schools of sympathy and
politics, but they could not lead troops or command a
victorious army. No doubt René was depressed and
in despair at the apparent paralysis of all effective
assistance. Then came the crushing intelligence that
Giovanna, the Queen of Naples, was dead, and that
he (René) was <i>de facto</i> King. This must have made
him desperate. He had no resources, and there
appeared no possibility of his obtaining possession of
his rights. How he chafed and fumed as he paced
his spacious chamber, and how defiantly he must have
gazed through its barred windows and at its closed
door! Duke René’s brain must have reeled.</p>

<p>Relief, however, came in quite an unexpected sort
of way. One morning the bolts of his door were
noisily shot back, and upon the threshold he beheld
two foreign gentlemen unknown to him. They knelt
and kissed his hand; then they offered him a permit
from the Duke of Burgundy, a sealed letter from
Duchess (now Queen) Isabelle, and a great official
despatch from the lately deceased Queen Giovanna.
The two emissaries were devoted adherents to the
House of Anjou-Provence&mdash;Baron Charles de Montelar
and Signore Vidal di Cabarus. They came, as
their credentials ordered, directly from the deathbed
of the Queen, to tell him from her that, “for the sake
of the love I had for King Louis,&mdash;now, alas!
departed,&mdash;I chose his noble brother René as my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
heir and successor. Long live King René!” Into
his hand the two gentlemen delivered the Sovereign’s
medallion and its royal chain of gold, and again they
did obeisance to their new Sovereign.</p>

<p>René accepted their homage chivalrously, if sorrowfully,
but his eye wandered to the smaller packet held
by di Cabarus, for he saw it was addressed to him in
his dear wife’s handwriting. Tearing open the cover,
he read with tears in his eyes the startling news that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Even whilst thou, my fond spouse, readest these
presents, I, thy loyal wife and royal consort, am
setting off at once, well mounted and numerously
attended, to Marseilles to take shipping for Naples,
there to receive in thy name the homage of the
Estates and to assume the government. I am taking
with me our second boy, Louis, with Yolande and
Marguerite, to show them to thy Neapolitan subjects,
but Jean I shall send to thee to comfort thee, by the
grace of the Duke of Burgundy. My sweet mother
will accompany him to cheer thee and to tell thee of
my good estate. Fare thee well, beloved.</p>

<p class="right">“Your <span class="smcap">Isabelle</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">At Nancy, 1434.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>Isabelle had learned promptness and wisdom from
her good mother-in-law, Queen Yolande, as well as
decision and courage from her father, Duke Charles,
and all these royal virtues she exhibited magnificently
at this extraordinary juncture. The two Neapolitan
envoys had, it appeared, gone direct to Nancy to
learn their new Queen’s pleasure, and had thus
become the bearers of her exhilarating mandate.
René received the intelligence of the masterful action
of his spouse with mixed feelings. He knelt at his
prie-dieu, and thanked God and the saints for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
noble self-sacrifice of his wife; then, rising proudly
from his knees, he embraced his two visitors, bestowed
upon each a ring from his own fingers, and gave them
instructions to carry his duty to the Duke of Burgundy,
praying for his instant release, and then to
proceed to Marseilles to convey to Queen Isabelle his
blessing and his approval of her splendid enterprise.
No sooner was he left to himself once more than he
collapsed, weeping like a child and chiding his Maker
and his captor in language lurid and forcible. The
irony of his position nearly drove him mad.</p>

<p>Queen Isabelle landed at Naples in due course,
and became the object of an extraordinary outburst
of enthusiasm. Hailed as Queen, and with King
René’s name ever reverberating from loyal lip to
loyal lip, she made no mistake, she had no illusions,
for she faced the fact at once that there were other
claimants for the vacant throne and the uneasy
crown. The King of Aragon she knew as a traditional
rival, and with him she had to deal most
seriously and methodically. He, indeed, directly
news of the Queen’s death reached him, had seized
the Castle of Gaeta, and thence had issued a proclamation
claiming the vacant throne. The Duke of
Sessa, the husband of Queen Giovanna’s favourite
confidante, Duchess Sancia, claimed the throne as
representing,&mdash;in descent from Robert, Count of
Avellino, her second husband,&mdash;Maria of Calabria-Durazzo,
sister of Queen Giovanna I. The Prince
of Taranto, grand-nephew of Giovanna I.’s third
husband and of her sister Maria’s third spouse, the
Emperor of Constantinople, entered his claims to
the whole kingdom. He pretended also that King
Louis III., René’s brother, had before his death at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Cosenza made him his heir of all Calabria. From
a distant kingdom came still another claimant.
The King of Hungary, Andrew, first consort of
Giovanna I., had by her a son, it was affirmed, but
who it was alleged had died in infancy. This child,
it was maintained, was living, now grown to man’s
estate. The child who died, and was buried as the
Queen’s son, was the son of a servant in the royal
suite, whilst the young Prince was removed from his
mother’s care and carried off to Hungary, and thus
reared.</p>

<p>Isabelle brushed all these claims aside,&mdash;save that
of Alfonso, who alone of the pretenders to the
crown was prepared to take up, as he had done for
years, the rights of Aragon in Naples, by force of
arms. Everywhere throughout the kingdom the
Anjou dynasty was popular; the country people
swore by Louis III., and acclaimed the proclamation
of René. The army alone was disaffected, and was
corrupted by Spanish gold. The royal treasury at
Naples was empty, the pay of the loyal troops was
in arrears; corruption and fraud filled every department
of State. The country gentry and peasantry
were ruined; they had been taxed and supertaxed
by the minions of Queen Giovanna II. From Provence
and Anjou not much monetary help could be expected,
and Lorraine and Bar were impoverished. All France
was suffering from the wreck of the Hundred Years’
War. René’s ransom required almost every penny
Yolande, Isabelle, and Marguerite, could raise by love
and threat. What could be done?</p>

</div>

<p>The new Queen had come to Naples to claim and
hold the kingdom for her husband, and she made up
her mind that she would try every expedient to that
end, cost what it might. To steal and to borrow
were not lines of conduct that appealed to her, but
she could beg, and beg she did. Upon this circumstance
historians have fastened, and have written
more or less eloquently in praise of a dauntless
Queen. After making up her mind to this course
of action, Isabelle at once put it into operation, and
an immense sensation was created in the city when
their beautiful and virtuous Queen, clothed simply
in native Neapolitan garb, without jewels or marks
of royalty, took her place morning by morning
outside the palace, in the open square, a macaroni
basket in her fair, white, ringless hands, and there
pleaded eloquently, in her sweet and musical voice,
for contributions for the honour of the King and for
the defence of the city. By her side, clad in
Neapolitan costumes, were her three little children&mdash;innocent,
fresh, and comely. “It was,” wrote a
chronicler, “a spectacle to move the heart and soul
of a marble statue&mdash;if such it hath. A Queen of
high degree and impeccability humbling herself for
her new country’s good. Looking upon her and her
children, one conjured up the base contrast offered
to our outraged nature by the late Queen, of
infamous memory.”</p>

<p>Money flowed in fast and full, and the wicker
cash-box daily carried almost more weight of copper
and silver, and of articles of jewellery, than the fine
strength of the virago Queen could support. Isabelle
set about a thorough overhauling of the resources of
the national exchequer. She personally rallied troops,
and inspected militarily her recruits; arrears of pay
were forthcoming, and the better-disposed men of
affairs she intuitively selected, and thus purged the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
seats of government. The King of Aragon, amazed
at Isabelle’s courage and ability, refrained from
attacking Naples. “I’ll fight with men,” he said,
“not with a woman!” he exclaimed. “Let us see
what she will do.”</p>

<p>The state of Naples in general, and of the Court
in particular, was worse than that of any Augean
stable. Indeed, of Court, strictly speaking, there was
none, for the less disreputable nobles had long ago
gone away to their country estates, taking the seeds
of corruption with them to sow among their tenantry.
The coteries which gathered around the abandoned
Queen like eagles round a carcass were split up into
murderous, lustful parties, and divided among evil-conditioned
brothels. Every man was every woman’s
prey, and every woman at the mercy of a libertine.
The whole city was a colossal orgie, and its inhabitants
sunk in the slough of unmitigated filth. The
turpitude of Pompeii found a parallel in the unrighteousness
of Naples. To pull aside the veil which
merciful Time has placed over those years of banality
and crime would be a sacrilege.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Down among the dead men let them lie!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Queen Isabelle, aghast, pulled her veil more closely
over her fair features, fixed her teeth, and clenched
her hands. Giovanna and all her doings were taboo
to her, and by the example and precept of a good
woman she gradually accomplished what appeared to
be a Herculean task&mdash;she brought the Neapolitans
to their senses. Mind, in those rapidly pulsating
Southern natures, quickly controls action, and the
human animal is not all bad even when so predestined
by Providence. Isabelle’s administration of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
kingdom of Naples during the three years of her
sole government was by way of being a moral
renascence of humanity, and, when René joined his
noble consort, the roses which decorated his triumphal
entry were richly perfumed by his wife’s sweet culture.</p>

<p>The prisoner of Bracon was set unconditionally
free in 1437, and he hurried away to Marseilles,
passing through his beloved country of Provence,
hailed everywhere and by everyone with ecstatic
devotion. At his port of departure for Naples he
was met by Queen Yolande. Never was there a
more affecting scene: the mother,&mdash;still bearing
traces of her early beauty and grace,&mdash;bowed down
with grief and aged prematurely; the son grown
older than his age under the rigours, mental and
physical, of his long imprisonment, but still devoted,
grateful, and chivalrous. Yolande had fain pressed
René to remain in France and comfort her declining
years, for, were they parted, she felt that she never
more should fold him to her heart&mdash;a heart pierced
deeply by the premature death of Louis. Yet she
played the Spartan mother, not spectacularly but
sincerely, and, hushing the sobs of parting, she bravely
waved the King of Naples her last farewell. His
father and his brother had both traversed the way
René was taking; their experience would doubtless
be his.</p>

<p>René had a great reception at Naples, and his joy
was unclouded when he embraced his noble wife and
his four young children, with tears coursing down his
cheeks. His recognition as Sovereign was celebrated
in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>cathedral. There he and Isabelle knelt hand
in hand in thankful confidence. Not long did the
new King remain in the bosom of his family. Alfonso
broke his parole, and prepared a fresh expedition to
attack Naples. René went off at once to Rome,
Florence, Venice, Genoa, and Milan, to rally help in
his emergency. During his captivity the King of
Aragon had played the cards so adroitly that he had
succeeded in detaching the Duke, his captor, from
the triple alliance. Moreover, he gained over to his
side Pope Eugenius IV. by promising to make Sicily
a fief of the Church. The Aragonese attack failed,
though the forces at King René’s command suffered
terribly.</p>

<p>At this juncture Queen Isabelle and her children,
except the heir to the throne, returned to France,
much against her will, but obedient to her royal
consort’s wishes. Jean, Duke of Calabria, now a
promising lad of nearly thirteen, remained with his
father at the post of danger. Alfonso was by no
means discouraged; he intended to be master of
Naples cost him what it might. In 1440 and 1441
he made fresh assaults on Naples and other seaports
of the Calabrian peninsula. All of these René
resisted triumphantly, but at Troia, on October 21
in the latter year, Alfonso in person defeated René’s
army under the command of Sforza and Sanseverino,
and made good his footing in the kingdom of Naples.
He further pressed home his attack upon the capital
by seizing the island of Ischia, where he compelled
the women, whether married or not, to wed his
victorious soldiers. René wearied of the contest;
he had been warring for twenty years, and he
yearned for repose. The Neapolitans quickly took
his measure, and his indecision and slackness of
energy disheartened his principal supporters. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
troops fell away from him, and when, in May, 1442,
the King of Aragon once more summoned the capital
to surrender, René meekly handed over the keys to
his enemy, and made his escape to Marseilles.
Alfonso on June 2 entered Naples in triumph, and
put an end to the rule of the Angevine Kings.</p>

<p>Alfonso has been styled “the Magnanimous”;
perhaps “the Philosopher” would fit his character
better. He was a student of metaphysics and a
classicist to boot, and, moreover, he had a ready wit.
He hated dancing and frivolity, and once remarked
that “a man who danced only differed from a fool
because his folly was shorter!” An ideal domestic
menage appeared to him to be “a blind wife and a
deaf husband.” His treasurer was one day giving
out scrip for 20,000 ducats, when an officer
standing by exclaimed: “Alack, if I only had that
amount I should be a happy man!” “Take it,”
replied the King!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Alfonso was hated by his new
subjects quite as thoroughly as René had been
beloved. The war dragged on; in Calabria the
Prince of Taranto raised once more the banner of
Anjou, and Giovanni Toreglia, a cousin of Lucrezia
d’Alagni, Alfonso’s last mistress, seized Ischia for
Jean, Duke of Calabria, René’s eldest son. René
himself made two more attempts to regain Giovanna’s
inheritance: in 1458 and 1461; but Charles VII.
and Louis XI. each failed him in turn with reinforcements.
Last of all, Jean, Duke of Calabria, was
decisively defeated at Troia in 1462 by Ferdinand I.,
Alfonso’s bastard son, who succeeded to the throne
of Naples after his father’s death in 1458, a man
treacherous and vindictive, and a libertine. “<i>Sic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>

<span class="smaller">MARGUERITE D’ANJOU&mdash;“THE MOST INTREPID OF QUEENS”</span></h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>“Margaret of Anjou was the loveliest, the best-educated,
and the most fearless Princess in Christendom!”
High praise indeed, but not more than her
due, and universally accorded her by every historian
who has undertaken to chronicle her character and
career.</p>

<p>Born at the Castle of Pont-à-Mousson,&mdash;one of
the finest in all Lorraine, and a favourite residence
of her father and mother,&mdash;on March 23, 1429,
Margaret was the youngest child of René, Duke of
Bar, and Isabelle of Lorraine his wife. Her father
was far away from his home when this pretty babe
first smiled upon her sweet mother. He was escorting
<i>La Pucelle</i> to Chinon, and leading the troops
of Charles VII. to victory. Her mother was
Lieutenant-General of the duchies&mdash;a devoted and
heroic spouse. The little girl’s cradle was rocked
amid the rivalries and hostilities of the Houses of
Lorraine and Vaudémont. She was the child of
Mars. She was baptized by Henri de Ville, Bishop
of Toul, who had just been created, by the Emperor
Sigismund, Prince of the Holy Roman Empire.
The Bishop was a trusty friend of Duke René in
shower and shine.</p>

<p>That ducal nursery, where faithful Théophaine la
Magine bore maternal nursing sway, was a merry
one; for Margaret’s brothers Jean, Louis, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>nd little
Nicholas,&mdash;twin with her only sister Yolande,&mdash;were
all vigorous youngsters. Then, besides these legitimate
children, the Castle of Bar-le-Duc sheltered
another Jean and Blanche and Madeleine, born to
their father out of wedlock. The ducal sepulchre
had given rest to two other baby boys, Charles and
René, own brothers to little Margaret.</p>

<p>Margaret’s experience of the joys and sorrows of
the world began at a very early age. Her doting
father was a captive away at Dijon under the
rigorous hand of the Duke of Burgundy, and Duchess
Isabelle was up and about seeking his deliverance.
René and she had succeeded Charles II. as Duke and
Duchess of Lorraine the same year that saw the
Tour de Bar receive its distinguished prisoner, and
upon Isabelle fell all the complications and difficulties
attending the succession. To be sure, she had the
very able help of the Dowager Duchess, her own
dear mother Marguerite, godmother of her little girl,
but the first consideration in her mind was her
husband’s liberty. Handing over the reins of government
to Duchess Marguerite and the Council of
State, Isabelle betook herself to the Court of
Charles VII. to claim his assistance and interference.
With her she took her two little daughters&mdash;Yolande,
only three years old, and Margaret, but two. Her
sons were sent to Burgundy to stand as hostages at
the Duke’s orders, and little Nicholas remained with
his grandmother at Nancy.</p>

</div>

<p>At Vienne, where the French Court was at the
time, having gone south from Reims and the coronation,
the King gave his brother-in-law’s consort a
very hearty greeting, but he hesitated to commit
himself to action which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>might ferment once more
evil blood between his people and the Burgundians.
Isabelle held by their hands, as she pleaded for her
dear husband, her two baby girls, and Charles’s
indecision was overcome by little Margaret, then a
dauntless infant, who ran up to him and insisted
upon being nursed upon his knee and kissed. A
child’s instinctive disingenuousness is affected by
magnetic natures regardless of conventions and proprieties;
how often and often again is this proved
to be axiomatic! That interview was memorable
for the meeting of Charles with a woman&mdash;to be sure,
then a girl&mdash;who would in after-years affect him and
his considerably. Agnes Sorel was in attendance
upon the Duchess Isabelle. Charles beheld her for
the first time, and her face and figure haunted him
for good and ill many a long day.</p>

<p>Not content with winning over the King of France
to intercede for the liberation of her consort, the
Duchess returned to Lorraine, and went off at once
to Vaudémont to plead with Count Antoine, the
Duke of Burgundy’s brother, in the same cause.
Vaudémont agreed to assist his kinswoman, but
upon one chief condition, among others&mdash;that she
would consent to Yolande, her eldest daughter, being
betrothed to his eldest son Ferri. There was, of
course, method in this extraordinary proposal,&mdash;for
the child was only three years of age,&mdash;and it was
this: He, the Count, claimed Lorraine, by the Salic
Law, as first heir male against Isabelle. Whatever
might eventuate, his son married to René’s
daughter would be an additional lien upon the
duchy. This policy also commended itself to
Isabelle’s prudential mind, and she gave a qualitative
consent dependent upon confirmation by Duke René
later on. The Count added a rider to the stipulati<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>on,
and that was the committal of the girl to the care
of his wife, the Countess, for education and training.
This, too, the Duchess accepted, although it cost
her sore to part with her dear child. Margaret and
Nicholas alone remained to solace her; but Isabelle
was far too strong a character to spend much time
in comforting or being comforted. Whilst René was
in durance vile she could not remain idle; so off she
went, taking Margaret and Nicholas with her, to
the Castle of Tarascon, in order to enlist the sympathies
and services of René’s devoted Provençals.</p>

<p>Isabelle’s coming into Provence provoked remarkable
demonstrations on the part of the warm-hearted
and loyal subjects of the county. Troubadours
and glee maidens flocked to the Rhone
shore; they sang, they danced, they ate, they drank,
and laid floral offerings and votive crowns at the feet
of their Countess and her tender children. Bonfires
blazed from shore to shore, and echoes of the rejoicings
might have been carried by the warm south wind
right into the dungeoned ears of their beloved Count.
Whilst Duchess Isabelle was in residence at Tarascon
negotiations were already on foot for the betrothal
of little Margaret. An eligible suitor arrived, the
young Pierre de Luxembourg, eldest son of the Count
of St. Pol, whose esquire, by a singular coincidence,
happened to be the recipient at Bulgneville of
Duke René’s sword. Arrangements for the ceremony
of espousal were, however, rudely interrupted
by a serious outbreak of plague, and Isabelle
and her children fled to Marseilles, where they
remained till René joined them, released upon a
year’s parole.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>
<p>When René was proclaimed King of Sicily,
Naples, and Jerusalem, Duke of Anjou, and Count
of Provence, upon the premature death of his elder
brother, Louis III., at Cosenza, Isabelle was again
at Marseilles, on her way to take possession of her
husband’s rights in Naples. Such pageants and
spectacles at those exhibited in her honour by the
exuberant Marseillais that city had never seen. She
rode through ranks on ranks of cheering citizens,
in a great state chariot covered with crimson and
gold, and wearing a queenly crown upon her head,
and with her were Jean, her eldest son, and Margaret
and Nicholas. The little Princess captivated everybody
by her <i>naïveté</i> and the graceful kissing of her
little hand. Margaret sent kisses flying through
every street, winning all men’s loyalty and the love
of all the boys.</p>

<p>Queen Isabelle and her children took up their
residence at the Palace of Capua. Queen Giovanna
offered her the new royal palace in Naples, but
Isabelle’s instinct was not in error when she chose
to dwell a little distance from the royal hussy.
There King René joined his family, bringing with
him both Louis, his second son, and Yolande. The
reunion was the happiest that could be. Upon the
King devolved, of course, the onus of government,
with the co-operation of Queen Giovanna. Queen
Isabelle, relieved from the trammels of the executive,
had now a much-longed-for respite in which to give
attention to the neglected education of her children.
She constituted herself their teacher-in-chief, but
called to her assistance the very noted writer of
French romance, Antoine de Salle. Alas! it was a
brief interlude indeed, for the studies had hardly
had time to affect the young pupils when the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of Aragon resumed his hostile demonstration against
the Angevine dynasty, and René and his were
locked in the grip of war. Very unwillingly Queen
Isabelle agreed to return to France with her children,
Naples being an armed camp and the whole country
in a turmoil. They wended their way leisurely to
Anjou, and not to Lorraine. Two reasons dictated
this course. Angers was the capital <i>par excellence</i>
of the dominions of the King of Sicily-Anjou, the
ancestral seat of his house, and Anjou was more
favourably conditioned than Lorraine or Bar for the
completion of the training of the royal children.
Queen Yolande was only too delighted to welcome
her brave daughter-in-law and to caress her beloved
grandchildren. She went off to the Castle of
Saumur, her favourite residence, and the walls of the
grim Castle of Angers once more resounded to the
merry laughter of childish games. Sadly enough
those joyous sounds yielded place to saddest dirges
when Prince Nicholas, not yet ten years old, died
suddenly of poison. This was the first break by
Death into that home circle.</p>

<p>The King and Queen were again in residence at
the Castle of Tarascon in 1443, and there, on
February 2, they received an imposing mission from
the Duke of Burgundy, headed by Guillaume
Harancourt, Bishop of Verdun, the Seigneurs Pierre
de Beauprémont and Adolphe de Charny, with
Antoine de Gaudel, the Duke’s principal secretary.
They came to Tarascon to negotiate a marriage
between the Duke’s nephew, Charles de Borugges,
son of Philippe, Count of Nevers, and the Princess
Margaret. This bridegroom expectant had been very
much in the matrimonial market before acce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>pting the
choice of his uncle. His first fiancée was Jeanne,
daughter of Robert, Count de la Marche; she gave
place to Anne, Duchess of Austria; and she in turn
was passed over before the greater charms of the
Angevine Princess. The contract of betrothal with
Pierre de Luxembourg was cancelled, and Charles de
Nevers was the choice of René and Isabelle.</p>

<p>The date for signing the marriage contract was
fixed, February 4, and to all the articles the King
and Queen readily assented. The dowry was
50,000 <i>livres</i>, but how that large sum was to be
raised neither René nor Isabelle had the slightest
idea; they had exhausted their exchequer in the
fruitless fight for Naples. The Duke of Burgundy,
acting as next of kin to the bridegroom-elect, promised
to settle a jointure of 40,000 <i>livres</i> on Margaret.
René had put forward a plea that the Duke should
forego 80,000 <i>écus d’or</i>, which was due on loans, and
Philippe agreed, receiving as further security and
indemnity to the towns of Neufchâteau, Preny, and
Longwy,&mdash;already in pawn to him,&mdash;the Castles of
Clermont, Varennes, and Renne, all in Argonne. A
secret clause was, however, at the eleventh hour
foisted upon the Angevine Sovereigns&mdash;a proceeding
quite in accordance with the proverbial
cunning of the Court of Burgundy. It stipulated
that the children of Charles and Margaret should
be heirs-presumptive of Sicily-Anjou-Provence,
Lorraine, and Bar, to the exclusion of the issue of
Ferri and Yolande de Vaudémont.</p>

<p>The judicial mind of King René would not let his
consent to this article be recorded until he had consulted
both the Count de Vaudémont and King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Charles of France. The former indignantly interviewed
the Duke of Burgundy, and stated his determination
to oppose the proposed marriage. Charles
resented the stipulation upon the ground of its
injustice, and warned his brother-in-law not to agree
to any such proposals. The marriage contract was
not signed, and, whilst acrimonious negotiations were
carried on both at Dijon and Vienne, another and a
very much more illustrious suitor of the hand of
Princess Margaret appeared upon the scene, no less a
person than Henry VI., King of England and France.</p>

<p>When the matter was first mooted, it was thought
nothing of by the King and Queen of Sicily, because
Henry had been all but betrothed to Isabelle, the
daughter of the Count of Armagnac, to whom he
owed so very much in earlier days. Indeed, the
gossip went so far as to link the English King’s name
in turn with all three daughters of the Count&mdash;the
loveliest girls in France: “Three Graces of Armagnac”
they were called. Henry had sent his favourite
painter, Hans of Antwerp, to paint the three comely
sisters, and his handiwork was so acceptable to the
royal young bachelor that he sat and gazed at them
for long, changing the order of their arrangement to
see which face of the beauteous three made the
most passionate appeal. The Armagnac marriage was
backed by all the influence of the Duke of Gloucester,
the younger of the King’s uncles, and lately Lord
Protector of England.</p>

<p>What drew Margaret of Anjou into the orbit of
Henry of England was that she had gone on a visit
to her aunt, Queen Marie of France, and had at the
French Court created quite a sensation. She was
nearly fourteen years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span> of age, and gave fascinating
indications of those charms of mind and person which
made her “the most lovely, the best-educated, and
the most fearless Princess in Christendom.”</p>

<p>Cardinal Beaufort was also a visitor at King
Charles’s castle at Chinon, and was immensely moved
by Margaret’s appearance and accomplishments. He
also detected her latent strength of character, and
certain traits therein which marked her unerringly as
the counterfoil of his royal pupil and master’s mental
and moral weaknesses. The Cardinal returned to
England full of the charms of the young Princess,
and descanted upon them so enthusiastically to the
King that Henry was in a perfect fever to behold the
beauteous Princess for himself. His amorous appetite
was further stimulated by conversations he quite
accidentally had with one Jules Champchevier, a
prisoner of war on parole from Anjou, lodging with
Sir John Falstaff, in attendance upon the King.
Champchevier was sent off to Saumur to obtain, if
possible, a portrait of the bewitching young Princess.
The King wished her to be painted quite simply and
naturally “in a plain kirtle, her face unpainted, and
her hair in coils.” He required information about
“her height, her form, the colour of her skin, her
hair, her eyes, and what size of hand she hath.”</p>

<p>Champchevier was taken prisoner on landing in
France, and threatened with death for breaking his
parole whilst executing the royal commission; but
news reaching Charles VII. of the unfortunate fellow’s
predicament, he laughed heartily at the situation
when he learned the reason of his mission, and forthwith
ordered his release. The idea of a matrimonial
contract between his royal rival and his royal niece
opened His Majesty’s eyes to possibilities created
thereby of a satisfactory peace between the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
countries. Once more,&mdash;and how many times before
and since!&mdash;a royal maiden’s heart contained the key
to great political issues.</p>

<p>The portrait was painted exactly to order&mdash;perhaps,
and quite correctly, with a little artistic embellishment.
The beauty of Nature is always enhanced by
the decorative features of art. Henry was charmed
with the sweet face he gazed and gazed upon, quite
putting into the shade the other reigning beauties of
his heart. He was himself as comely as might be,
just four-and-twenty, highly educated, his mind unusually
refined. In thought and deed he was pure
and devout, and very shy of strange women. Upon
the latter head he was emphatic, for when at Court
or elsewhere he beheld women with open bosoms
<i>à l’Isabeau de Bavière</i> he was shocked, and turned
away his face, muttering: “Oh fie! oh fie! ye be
much to blame!” His earnest wish was marriage,
not concubinage. The King’s choice very soon
became noised abroad, and the Court became agitated
and divided. The Duke of Gloucester, the King’s
next of kin and heir-presumptive to the throne,
championed the Armagnac match, whilst Cardinal
Beaufort and the Earl of Suffolk decided for Margaret
of Anjou.</p>

<p>There was, however, an obstacle in the way, quite
consistently with the proverbial rugged course of all
true love; the Count of Nevers refused to release
his fiancée. He was prepared, he averred, to cancel
the contentious clause in the marriage contract, made
at Tarascon, and not to insist upon anything derogatory
to the dignity of King René and his elder
daughter, the Countess Ferri de Vaudémont. The
prospect to René of such an auspicious union, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>ever,
which would place his daughter upon one of the
greatest of European thrones, was too dazzling to be
ignored, and the outcome of the imbroglio was the
assembling in January, 1444, of a mixed Commission,
representing England, France, Anjou, and Burgundy,
at Tours, whereat two protocols were framed:
a treaty for a two years’ peace, and a marriage agreement
between the King of England and the Princess
of Anjou. This was signed on May 28 of the same
year. The marriage contract thus drawn out was
very favourable to the House of Sicily-Anjou: Henry
asked for no dowry, but required only the rights
transmitted to King René by Queen Yolande with
respect to the kingdom of Minorca. Henry further
agreed to the retrocession of Le Mans and other points
in Anjou held by the English.</p>

<p>To the Earl of Suffolk, the leading English plenipotentiary,
was mainly due the successful issue of the
conference. Henry created him Marquis and Grand
Seneschal of the Royal Household. The King furthermore
despatched to him an autograph letter to the
following effect: “As you have lately, by the Divine
favour and grace, in our name, and for us, engaged
verbally the excellent, magnificent, and very bright
Margaret, the second daughter of the King of Sicily,
and sworn that we shall contract marriage with her,
we consent thereto, and will that she be conveyed to
us over the seas at our expense.” Arrangements were
forthwith made for the immediate marriage of the
Princess. Suffolk,&mdash;one of the handsomest and most
cultivated men of the day, though now verging on
fifty years of age,&mdash;headed a majestic embassy to
Nancy, where the Sicily-Anjou Court was in residence.
He bore with him a dispensation from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
royal master to act as his proxy at the nuptial ceremony,
and to receive in his name the hand of his
fascinating bride. It was indeed a notable function,
and held in the ancient cathedral of Tours, whereat
all that was royal, noble, brave, and beautiful, forgathered.
The witnesses for Margaret were the
King and Queen of France, the King and Queen of
Sicily-Anjou, and the Duke and Duchess of Calabria,
with the Dauphin Louis. The Princess’s supporters
were the Duke of Alençon, the most gallant and most
accomplished Prince in France, and the Marquis of
Suffolk, the premier noble of England. Upon the
latter’s consort, the clever Marchioness, devolved the
duties of Mistress of the Robes.</p>

<p>That day,&mdash;February 27, 1445,&mdash;was a red-letter
day in the annals of all three kingdoms. Louis
d’Harcourt, Bishop of Toul, was chief celebrant,
assisted by half the prelates of France, and Cardinal
Beaufort was in choir to administer the Papal
benediction. The young Queen’s Maids of Honour
were the two most lovely girls in France&mdash;Jehanne
de Laval, in the suite of Queen Marie, and Agnes
Sorel, in that of Queen Isabelle. It was a singular
and delightful coincidence that these two lovely
damsels were in evidence on that auspicious
day; for were they not the charming cynosures respectively
of two pairs of kingly eyes&mdash;René and
Charles!</p>

<p>The interest and the importance of the celebration
was heightened considerably by the fact that there
was a double wedding: Count Ferri de Vaudémont
and Princess Yolande of Sicily-Anjou were united in
the bond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>s of matrimony immediately after the nuptials
of the new Queen. Fêtes and festivities were carried
out right royally for eight whole days and nights.
The “Lists” were held in the great wide Place de
Carrière in Nancy. Charles and René met in
amicable conflict, but it was the former’s lance which
was tossed up, and René gained the guerdon, which
he presented gallantly enough to his sister, the Queen
of France. The champion of champions, however,
was none other than Pierre de Luxembourg, the
earliest fiancée of Queen Margaret, and he had the
happy satisfaction of receiving the victor’s crest of
honour from her hands&mdash;now another’s! Minstrelsy
and the stage also lent their aid to the general
rejoicings. King René was already styled the
“Royal Troubadour,” and he rallied his melodious,
merry men in a goodly phalanx, whilst he himself
led the music in person and recited his own new
marriage poem. The theatre proper had only very
recently been established in France. Church
mysteries and pageant plays had had their vogue,
when, in 1402, Charles VI. granted his charter to
“<i>La Confrèrerie de la Passion</i>,”&mdash;a company, or
guild, of masons, carpenters, saddlers, and other
craftsmen, and women,&mdash;which he established at the
village of St. Maur, near Vincennes. These merry
fellows introduced to their distinguished audience, in
the Castle of Nancy, secular travesties of the well-worn
religious spectacles, and won the heartiest
applause. King René personally, through the
gracious hands of the royal bride, decorated the
actors with gay ribbons and medallions.</p>

<p>The dress of the right royal company was, as may
well be supposed, sumptuous in the extreme; but
among the wearers of rich attire a pathetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span> note was
struck, when it was mooted that royal Margaret
had been dressed for her bridal by Queen Marie, her
aunt, because her own parents were too much impoverished
to supply suitable marriage robes! The
bride’s dress was mainly that worn by Queen Marie
herself, twenty-three years before, at her own nuptials
with Charles VII. The kirtle was of cloth of gold
cunningly embroidered with the white lilies of France&mdash;the
same for Anjou; the robe of state was of
crimson velvet bordered with ermine, which also
formed the trimming of the stomacher she wore.
Her hair was dressed <i>à l’Angloise</i>, its rich golden
coils being crowned with a royal diadem, almost the
only jewel of Queen Yolande’s treasury which had
not been sold or pawned. The little Queen was
slight of build and short of stature for her age; very
fair of skin, with a peachy blush; her eyes light
blue, her hair a golden auburn; her whole face and
figure lent themselves to delightful expression and
graceful pose. Above all, she was very self-possessed,
and gave all beholders the impression of ability and
decision beyond the average.</p>

<p>With respect to King René’s inability to provide
a fitting trousseau for his daughter, there is an entry
in the <i>Comptes de Roy René</i> which indicates that
he was not unmindful of the sartorial requirements of
his family. Under date September 11, 1442, is an
order, addressed to Guillaume de la Planche, merchant
of Angers, for 11 <i>aulnes</i> of cloth of gold, embroidered
in crimson and pleated, at 30 <i>écus</i> per <i>aulne</i>,
with a suite of trimming to cost 30 <i>livres</i>. At
the same time François Castargis, furrier of Angers,
is directed to supply ten dozen finest marten skins at
a cost of £15 7s. 6d., and to pack and despatch
them to the care of the Seigneur de Precigny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
at Saumur, “for dresses for Madame Margaret.”
This de Precigny was Bertrand de Beauvau,
who married King René’s natural daughter Blanche
d’Anjou.</p>

<p>At the wedding of Henry VI. and Margaret at
Tours and Nancy, the courtiers were very richly attired
in short jackets or tunics of pleated brocade trimmed
with silk fringes; their body hose was of parti-coloured
spun silk to match their tunics. Their shoes
were made long, of white kid with high heels, and
were laced with golden thread. Calves where skimpy
were padded, and narrow shoulders were puffed out.
They wore long pendent sleeves, pricked and furred.
Their hair, generally worn <i>à la Nazarene</i>, hung in
thick straight locks upon their shoulders, cut square
over the forehead. A small <i>berretta</i>, with a heron’s
plume and a jewelled brooch, completed the costume.
Chains of gold and jewels were worn at will. The
ladies of the Court wore short kirtles or petticoats,
with long bunched-up trains of silk brocade in two
contrasting colours; cloth of gold was reserved for
dames of royal degree. Strict rules were observed
in the wearing of fur&mdash;its quality and its breadth;
ermine was reserved for royalty. Their gloves were
long-fingered, and their shoes long-toed, the points
of each being caught up with thin golden chains to
their garters&mdash;“<i>un chose ridicule et absurde</i>,” as
Paradin wrote. The salient mark adopted by the
ladies of fashion was noted in their coiffures. The
popular name, or, rather, the name of scorn,&mdash;thanks
to Father Thomas of Brittany,&mdash;for the astounding
headgear <i>à la mode</i>, “<i>hennin</i>,” was in select circles
called <i>en papillons</i>&mdash;“butterflied.” Some ladies had
double horns like the mitres of Bishops, some <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>had
round redoubts “<i>comme les donjons</i>,” some were half-moon
shape, and some like hearts, whilst many goodly
dames made themselves still more ridiculous by wearing
miniature windmills! All these erections were
made of white stiffened linen, built up on frameworks
of wicker and carton. Over all <i>floquarts</i>,&mdash;thin gauze
veils,&mdash;were gently cast. Collars of jewels and ropes
of pearls were <i>de rigueur</i>, and most of the ladies
wore badges of chivalry&mdash;the guerdons of their lords
and sweethearts. One very pretty conceit was introduced
at the time of Queen Margaret’s marriage&mdash;a
dainty holder for the necessary pocket-handkerchief.
This took the shape of a small heart of gold suspended
from an enamelled white <i>marguerite</i>, and hung
at the side of the jewelled cincture. The ladies’
shoes were richly embroidered with seed-pearls
and gold thread. Rings were worn outside the
gloves.</p>

<p>Among the suite sent by Henry to attend upon
his bride were the Countess of Shrewsbury and
the Lady Emma de Scales, with five Barons and
Baronesses of the realm. In attendance, too, was
Scrivener William Andrews, Private Secretary to the
King, who acted as juris-consult at the signing of
the marriage registers. In his diary he wrote:
“Never have I seen or heard of a young Princess
so greatly loved and admired.”</p>

<p>Upon the ninth day after the marriage ceremony
Queen Margaret took a tearful but brave farewell
of her fond parents and of the princely company, and
King René committed her proudly, yet regretfully,
to the care of the Marquis of Suffolk. An imposing
cavalcade accompanied the parting Queen; indeed,
all Nancy, noble and bourgeois, rich and poor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span> turned
out to do honour to Her Majesty. King Charles
and Queen Marie went as far as Toul, and then bade
their niece adieu. Charles was strangely sad, and
said with a deep-drawn sigh: “I seem to have done
nothing for you, my well-beloved niece, in placing
you upon one of the greatest thrones in Europe, but
it certainly is worthy of possessing you as Queen.”
Queen Marie’s farewell was very affecting: “I bid
you God-speed, my best-loved niece. I am sure I
do not know what we shall do without you. I weep
for you, my child!”</p>

<p>King René and Queen Isabelle travelled with their
dear daughter right on to Bar-le-Duc, where the
cortège was enthusiastically received, and where a
rest was called over the Sunday, and parents and
daughter partook of the Communion. Then, on the
morrow, Margaret broke down completely at the
parting, and both René and Isabelle gave way to
sobs and tears. If the prospect of the royal marriage
had been pleasant to them all, its realization and the
future filled their hearts with apprehension. A
dearly loved child was now to make her way all
alone among strangers&mdash;too young to go so far from
home, but too good to err.</p>

<p>“<i>Je fais peur pour vous, ma fille</i>,” cried the
sorrowing father, “<i>en vous plaçant sur un des plus
grands trônes de Chrétienté; que le bon Dieu vous
gardiez. Pour moi et pour vôtre mère, nous sommes
tous les deux désolés.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_A_9" id="FNanchor_A_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_9" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Queen Isabelle’s heart was
too full for words. She folded her child to her
bosom, and the two wept together. It was Margaret
who first dried her tears, and said bravely: “<i>N’ayez
aucun regret pour moi; je serai vôtre fille la plus
devouée pour jamais. Si mon corps veçut en Anglet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>erre,
mon âme restera tousjours en France avec
la vôtre.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_9" id="Footnote_A_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_9"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> “I am fearful for you, my daughter, in placing you upon one
of the mightiest thrones in Christendom; may the good God
protect you. As for me and your mother, we are filled with desolation.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> “Do not feel any regret for me; I shall be always your most
devoted daughter. If my body dwells in England, my soul shall
rest always in France with yours.”</p>

</div>

<p>Bare-headed, King René stood at the castle portal
till Margaret and her escort had faded from his sight;
then he and the Queen shut themselves up in their
apartments and gave way to their pent-up feelings.
Travelling as the Queen of England, Margaret had
now for her supporters her brother, the Duke of
Calabria, the Duke of Alençon, and the courteous
Marquis of Suffolk. Leisurely enough the company
traversed the fertile fields of Champagne, ever aiming
for the north French coast. Besides a strong escort
of soldiery, in the royal train were seventeen knights
and two esquire-carvers, sixty-five esquires, twenty
grooms, and 174 servitors of all kinds, and with
them serving-maids and dressers. At every stopping-place
heartiest greetings awaited the young Queen,
and Princes and nobles knelt to pay their homage.
The English garrisons <i>en route</i> were forward in their
loyal salutations; their new Queen was the pledge
of a greatly-yearned-for <i>entente cordiale</i>.</p>

<p>At Nantes the Duke of York, King Henry’s near
kinsman, and the representative of the older line of
the English Royal House, received the Queen, and
entertained her in the castle of the French Kings.
On March 23 the royal progress ended at Rouen,
where a week’s rest was called. Bicknoke, in his
“<i>Computus</i>,” has enumerated several cur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>ious items
in the bill of costs which covered the lengthy journey
from Lorraine. The Barons and Baronesses of the
Queen’s suite received each four shillings and sixpence
a day, the knights had half a crown each a
day, and, at the tail of the following, the grooms
were paid no more than fourpence per diem. At
Rouen the Queen paid four shillings and ninepence
for fourteen pairs of shoes to give to certain poor
women of the town. She also made many purchases
of second-hand silver plate from a silversmith,
Jean Tubande by name. The articles were chiefly
cups and plates which bore the arms of Henry,
Count of Luxembourg, father of her first fiancé.
These escutcheons the Queen had removed, and in
place of them <i>marguerites</i> were engraved. The
Queen, moreover, came short of ready cash, so she
pawned some of her real silver wedding presents to
the Marchioness of Suffolk, that she might have the
wherewithal for gifts to the seamen on her transport
to England.</p>

<p>The royal party embarked in river boats, and made
for Honfleur, where the <i>Cokke John</i>, a great galley,
was waiting off the port. Such a stormy passage
as that which was the prelude to Queen Margaret’s
triumphant progress to the English capital had
hardly been exceeded for fury in the memory of the
most ancient mariners. Thunder and lightning and
sheets of ice-cold water threatened to destroy the
stately craft and to engulf her lordly fares. After
beating about in the Channel for one whole day
and night, with utmost difficulty the harbour of
Porchester was attained on April 10.</p>

<p>It was rather hard upon the Queen’s impoverished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
exchequer that she should have been called upon to
pay £5 4s. 10d. for her pilot, £13 6s. 8d. for new
hawsers, and £9 7s. for alterations and repairs in
the vessel.</p>

<p>The terrified young Queen had never beheld the
angry sea before nor tasted its misery, and she was
utterly prostrated in her state-room, and wept and
cried for her mother and to God for help. The
Marquis raised her inanimate form gently in his arms,
and wading bravely to land through the scudding
sea-foam, he bore his precious burden, marching
manfully along the fresh-rush-strewn streets of
the little fishing town. King Henry was at Winchester,
anxiously awaiting couriers who should gladden
his ears by the news of his royal bride’s arrival, and
he galloped off at once to greet her at the Goddes
House of Southwick, whither she was borne for
rest and treatment. Unhappily, Margaret had contracted
some infectious complaint,&mdash;perhaps chicken-pox,&mdash;and,
very tantalizing for herself and Henry,
their meeting was postponed until her illness had
abated.</p>

<p>At the priory church of St. Mary and All Saints
the ceremony of the English espousal was celebrated
by Cardinal Kemp, and Henry placed upon Margaret’s
finger the ring which he had worn at his
coronation in Paris eighteen years before. If the
King was charmed by the portrait of his Queen, he
was transported with joy and passion when he beheld
and embraced beauteous Margaret. The half of her
excellence had not been revealed in pigment; she
was more, much more, lovely and attractive than he
had imagined. Preparations for the state nuptials
were hurried forward, and also for the coronation of
the Queen, and Henry with his bride rowed on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Southampton, saluted as they passed by all the
shipping in the Solent. Two Genoese galleys in
particular were gaily festooned and manned, and as
the royal barge swept by seven trumpeters blew a
wedding fanfare, and then the crews shouted their
loud “<i>Evviva</i>.” Margaret insisted on sending for the
two captains of the foreign crafts, and gave them
£1 3s. 4d. “for plaieing so merrielie my musique”&mdash;so
the Queen phrased it. Another heavy item in
the cost of her progress was her doctor’s fee; Maistre
François of Nancy claimed £5 9s. 2d. for his professional
services upon the journey. A further delay
was caused in the completion of the nuptial arrangements
by reason of the poverty of the Queen’s wardrobe.
Her trousseau was quite unworthy of her
rank, and Henry, although himself as poor as a
King might be, despatched messengers to London
to summon Margaret Chamberlayne, a famous tire-worker,
and a number of craftswomen with sumptuous
materials for the wedding gown. The King, indeed,
had to pawn his own jewellery and plate to furnish
sufficient funds for the double ceremony.</p>

<p>Henry of England and Margaret of Anjou were
married by Cardinal Beaufort in the abbey church
of Titchfield on April 22. The bride was just
sixteen years of age&mdash;already a woman, but with the
heart of a man. Most extraordinary presents were
showered upon the young Queen: a lion in a cage,
a score of hedgehogs, a dozen thick all-wool blankets,
two tuns of English wine, a suit of bronze silver
armour, several chairs,&mdash;two of state,&mdash;five young
lambs’ fleeces, and so forth. Then the royal progress
began to the capital. Halfway between Fareham
and London the Duke of Gloucester, with 500 arme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>d
and superbly mounted retainers, greeted the King
and Queen, and conducted them to the palace at
Greenwich. Triumphal arches spanned the road,
and maidens scattered spring blossoms before the
royal couple.</p>

<p>On May 30 the King and Queen quitted Blackheath
for Westminster, passing many notable pageant
spectacles&mdash;“Noah’s Ark,” “Grace,” “God’s Chancellor,”
“St. Margaret,” the “Heavenly Jerusalem,”
and so forth&mdash;all marshalled in their honour. Somewhat
wearied by the dust and the shaking of her
chariot, and deafened by the plaudits of the crowds,
Margaret was handed down by the King, at the
great west door of the royal abbey. Her entry was
accompanied by minstrelsy, for King René had
sent over for the ceremonial a large company of the
troubadours and glee maidens of Bar, Lorraine, and
Provence, under the orders of his Groom of the
Stole, Sire Jehan d’Escose. The cost of this expedition
ran up to nearly £100, a great sum for the
poor King of Sicily to disburse.</p>

<p>King Henry spared no expense, but ran still more
heavily into debt to make the crowning of his Queen
magnificent. Rarely had such a gallant and splendid
company gathered for a royal wedding. Everybody
wore the Queen’s badge&mdash;a red-tipped daisy. Three
days were set apart for tournaments between Palace
Yard and Broad Sanctuary, whereat the new Queen
presided, wearing the Queen-consort’s jewelled crown
of England.</p>

<p>Margaret was now <i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i> Queen of
England and mistress of her destiny&mdash;her husband’s,
also. What a unique elevation it was for a youn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>g
girl of sixteen, all alone among strangers, rivals, and
adventurers! A false step seemed inevitable; indeed,
absolute rectitude and tactfulness of conduct under
the exigeant circumstances which surrounded her
would have tried the grit of the stoutest mind and
the grasp of the strongest hand. Dubbed “<i>La
Française</i>” by men and women jealous of the King
and of herself, she had to steer her course amid
endless pitfalls placed in her way. Warfare and
politics were the two chief contentions of the day.
As for the first, she (Margaret) was its mascot, and
warriors laid down their arms at her feet; but with
respect to the wordy warfare of parties and their
intrigues and plots the young Queen danced upon
the thinnest ice, and unconsciously she slipped.
She gave herself into the hands, quite naturally, of
the party which held first to the King and herself,
as opposed to that which sought initially self-interest.
The Duke of Gloucester was the leader of the loyal
section of her lieges, and to him the young Queen
turned for light and leading.</p>

<p>Very soon the impress of Margaret’s strong
character made itself felt in every quarter. She
spared neither the Duke of York himself, nor any
other rival to her own Lord and King; but what
could a child still in her teens do against the cabals
of crafty and influential foes? Henry was as weak
as water; he hated political questions, caring very
much more, of course, for peaceful intercourse with
his fascinating spouse, and for the delights of leisure
and learning, than for the turmoil of Parliament and
the vexed questions of the day. York held Henry
in his hand, but Margaret was a doughty nut to
crack, and she kept him in his proper place.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>
<p>Letters written from Sheen and Windsor to
Queen Isabelle by her loving daughter show how
happy was her state. Henry’s passionate love she
returned as passionately, and their loves made for
peace both at home and abroad. Literary pursuits
and benevolent aims were in both their minds: the
King founded Eton College, and King’s College,
Cambridge, in 1446; the Queen, Queen’s College,
Cambridge. Together they invited Italian, French,
and Flemish craftsmen to settle in England, and teach
their ignorant but not unwilling subjects some of the
arts of peace. The poor were relieved, the naked
clothed, the hungry fed; but when all estates of the
realm seemed secure and in prosperity, the dark spectre
of sedition rose at the beck and call of the Duke
of York. King Henry had to rouse himself and lay
low the insurrection of Jack Cade and 30,000
mislead Kentish men. This was the beginning of
troubles.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>For some little time Margaret had detected signs
in her consort’s speech and manner that caused her the
gravest solicitude. She had witnessed the mental depression
and lassitude of her uncle, the King of France,
and she had grieved for her beloved aunt’s (Queen
Marie’s) anxieties. The insanity of King Charles VI.,
too, had been one of the sad family histories of her
school days in Anjou. Now she was faced with a
trouble far away more terrible than any of these. In
1453 the King’s memory began to fail, he was bereft
of feeling, and gradually he lost his power of walking.
The malady, indeed, had shown itself during the
Christmas revels at Greenwich. The Queen was
already broken-hearted by the news she receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>d from
France of the critical state of her mother’s health,
and when, on March 5, she heard of her death, poor
Margaret was indeed disconsolate. In pain she
turned to Henry for comfort, but he failed to comprehend
her sorrow. All around were men and
women intriguing against herself and him; alone she
had to bear her trouble, and the trouble was intensified
in pathos by the fact that she was at last enceinte.
Would her child be stillborn, she asked herself many
a time; how could she expect otherwise when so
utterly cast down? Then she realized the loneliness
of a throne. The menace of the Duke of York was
a scourge to wear her down, and his denunciation of
her barrenness an unspeakable affront.</p>

<p>Crushed indeed she was, and yet she had to play
the man; for she was both King and Queen of
England, and while she lived she determined that
none should sap her authority. Henry subsided
into imbecility, but Margaret’s will matched and
vanquished York’s, although he was proclaimed
“Protector of the Realm and Church.” The year
sped on, but it brought joy to the sad heart of the
lonely Queen, and the whole nation shared her
happiness. On October 11 she brought forth her
first-born child, a son and heir, a fact of the vastest
importance for all concerned, friend and foe. York
at once denounced the child for a changeling; but the
nation would not have it so, and he was christened
Edward publicly at Westminster, and created Prince
of Wales, so named because his birthday was that of
the holy King St. Edward.</p>

<p>Alas! the King could not be roused sufficiently
to recognize his son, nor, indeed, his wife, and t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>his
was construed by York and his party as proof conclusive
against the truth of the Queen’s accouchement.
At the same time they threw out insinuations
against her character with respect to relations with
many prominent men of her entourage.</p>

<p>The chivalrous spirit of the Queen felt York’s
false imputations crushingly. Her convalescence was
retarded, and when she came to be churched at the
Abbey of Westminster, she was almost too prostrate
to go through the ceremony. Like the noble woman
that she was, she roused herself; and when she
beheld the distinguished and numerous suite awaiting
her,&mdash;the forty most influential peeresses in the
land,&mdash;she took heart, and was herself once more.
She assumed her costly churching robe. It was of
white, gold-embroidered silk and was bordered with
500 sable pelts, and it had cost £554 16s. 8d.</p>

<p>The Duke’s despicable conduct was flouted when
Christmas next came round, for on the Feast of the
Nativity the Queen presented herself holding her
babe in her arms before the King. To her unspeakable
joy, Henry held out his hands and drew her and
the infant Prince to his breast, and out loud thanked
God for the recovery of his reason and acknowledged
the child as his. York was away on mischief bent,
and Margaret did not fail to make use of the opportunity
for checkmating his unworthy aspirations.
She took the King to the Parliament, then sitting,
and at his command and in his presence the decree
appointing York Protector of the kingdom was
revoked, and Henry, Margaret, and Edward, assumed
their orthodox positions. This step was the first
move in the great war game which devastated the
whole realm, and ended, alas! in the absolute undoing
of the King, the Queen, and the Prince. York,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
hearing what had transpired at Westminster, hurried
from the Welsh border with 5,000 armed followers.
The King met him at St. Albans, and ordered him to
disband his troop and salute the royal banner. The
Duke refused to obey only on impossible conditions.</p>

<p>But what of King René and Queen Isabelle?
Their hearts were torn asunder, we may be sure, at
the contemplation of their Margaret’s peril. They
were powerless to assist her save by their whole
soul’s sympathy; besides, they were faced by a contrariety
of facts. The all too brief “truce of Margaret”
was broken in 1449, and René was summoned
to support King Charles and fight against the
servants of her consort,&mdash;her subjects too,&mdash;for,
spite of being “<i>La Française</i>,” she had won all hearts
in bonnie England. A beautiful girl and a brave is
unmatchable! Fortune of war favoured the French-Anjou
colours, and Charles became master of Normandy
and all English-held North France. Guienne,
too, was yielded to the valiant young Duke of
Calabria. Moreover, the war-galleys of “<i>Le Petit Roy
de Bourges</i>” scoured the Channel, and gained prizes
and renown for Charles and René off the English
coast.</p>

<p>Somerset’s defeat was a loss of credit, however, to
Queen Margaret, and York of course made the most
of it. He boasted that, “as Henry was fitter
for a cell than a throne, and had transferred his
authority to Margaret, the affairs of the kingdom
could not be managed by a Frenchwoman, who cared
only for her own power and profit.” To placate this
arrogance the Queen made a tactless move: she
named the Duke Governor of Ireland, thus adding to
his prestige and opportunity. Talbot’s death at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Albany further weakened the King’s authority and
Margaret’s strategy.</p>

<p>Upon the death of Queen Isabelle, so deeply
mourned, not alone by her daughter in England, but
by all the chivalry of France, René devolved his
authority in Bar and Lorraine upon Jean, Duke of
Calabria, intending to withdraw gradually from the
responsibilities of government. His efforts, however,
were discounted by the entreaties of Francesco
Sforza, Duke of Milan, and his Florentine allies, that
he should again take up arms and appear in the field
against King Alfonso of Aragon and the Venetians
who were supporting him. René was victorious, but
the palm of triumph was withered in his hand by the
news that reached him on his way back to France:
civil war had broken out in England, and Margaret
was in command of the Lancastrians. Margaret, so
lovely, so cultivated, and so fearless, was adding
lustre to the heroic deeds of the House of Anjou&mdash;but
what terrible risks she ran! The initial victory at
Wakefield was tarnished by the irony of circumstances,
and, though decreed by her in the moment of
her emphatic triumph, York’s grey head speared upon
the walls of York must have shocked her sense of
magnanimity.</p>

<p>Margaret led her troops in person,&mdash;they worshipped
the ground she trod,&mdash;but her splendid
courage was of no avail at the second battle of
St. Albans. Henry was deposed, and York’s eldest
son, the Earl of March, was proclaimed King as
Edward IV. Margaret never accepted defeat; she
quailed not, but off she went with her little son, who
was never parted from her side, to Yorkshire and the
North.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“Love Lady-Day” was the quaint if somewhat
hypocritical name bestowed by general consent upon
March 25, 1458. On that auspicious Lady-Day a
very notable assemblage gathered together at the
Palace of Westminster. The Queen had personally
summoned the leaders of the rival factions to meet
the King and accompany him and herself in procession
to St. Paul’s, to crave from on high the spirit
of conciliation. The streets were crowded with loyal
and appreciative citizens, whose delight knew no
bounds as they witnessed pass before them the King
in his crown, his horse’s bridle held by a “White
Rose” knight and a “Red.” Then followed the
Queen in a litter, escorted by the new Duke of York,
Somerset hand in hand with Salisbury, Essex with
Warwick, and others in order of precedence. No
man was armed, no woman feared, and joy-bells tossed
themselves over and over again, swung by stalwart
ringers. <i>Te Deum</i> was sung, but as the progress
turned westward rumblings of thunder made wise-acres
shake their heads,&mdash;and in sooth they had good
cause, as matters chanced,&mdash;at the dire omen.</p>

<p>Warwick was the <i>bête noire</i> of the reconciliation.
By instinct and preference a plotter-royal, he incurred
the Queen’s suspicion by a system of sea-piracy he
established, and because of inconsiderate language
about the elder line of Plantagenet. An unfortunate
street fracas led to Warwick’s imprisonment. He
was too proud to plead guilty, the Queen too jealous
to release him. York and Salisbury at once enrolled
their retainers, and stood ready to deliver Warwick.
The fruits of the reconciliation fell instantly to the
ground, and the complement of “Love Lady-Day”
was renunciation and conflict <i>à l’outrance</i>. Before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the fresh outbreak of hostilities, whilst the King
retired for rest and quietude to St. Albans Abbey,
the Queen, accompanied by the baby Prince, made a
progress through the Midlands. The child’s winning
ways touched every heart, and when he distributed
to struggling hands everywhere the cognizance of his
patron saint, St. Edward,&mdash;little silver swans,&mdash;everybody
swore to be his henchman and to stand by
Henry and Margaret. Salisbury hung upon the
skirts of the Queen’s cortège, and Margaret inquired
his business. His curt reply determined her to
demand his body, alive or dead. At Bloreheath
adherents of both sides met, and then Margaret had
her baptism of blood; her own was tinged with
warriors’ strains from Charlemagne of old, and in her
veins the old lion sprang up phœnix-like. Margaret
saw red. She offered two courses only to her
rebellious and disaffected subjects, submission or
death&mdash;no quarter. Alas! her experience was the
common one, the faithlessness of friends.</p>

<p>The Battle of Northampton, on July 10, 1460,
was lost by the treachery of Lord Grey de Ruthen.
The Queen and Prince were posted upon an eminence
to view the fight, and her military instinct detected
the base defection whereby Warwick was enabled to
take the King’s army in the rear. Henry was
captured before her eyes, and Margaret, powerless
to retrieve the disaster, fled with her boy at once to
the North. By a circuitous route they reached the
impregnable walls of Harlech Castle. Henry was
led in mock triumph to the Tower, whence Warwick
had the effrontery to demand the custody of the
persons of the Queen and Prince. Margaret
expressed her indignation at the insult emphatically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
but, waiting not to bandy useless words, she hurried
off to Scotland to seek sympathy and assistance.
Meanwhile the Duke of York formally claimed the
crown. Margaret’s response was impressive. Without
difficulty she roused Scottish enthusiasm,&mdash;generally
so slow to move,&mdash;and, sweeping across the
border, she gathered in her train an army of 60,000
men, and appeared before the gates of York. There
she called a plenary council of lords, to whom she
expressed her determination “to rest not till I have
entered London and set free the King.”</p>

<p>York, taken by surprise, hastened to meet the
valiant Queen, and found her encamped at Wakefield.
Warned of his approach, she sent heralds to his
quarters, who in her name defied the Duke “to
meet her in honest, open fight.” He held back, and
then she poured the vials of her scorn upon his head:
“Doth want of courage,” she exclaimed, “allow thee
to be browbeaten by a woman&mdash;fie on thee, thou
traitor!” The battle was joined on December 30,
and gained in less than half an hour. A troop of
horse, headed by young Lord Clifford,&mdash;and followed
immediately by the Queen, mounted and armed,&mdash;made
an impetuous dash to where the Duke’s
standard hung heavy in the still, damp air. It they
captured, and forthwith threw it over Margaret’s
knees, and with his sword Clifford struck the rebel
leader down from his horse, and slew him as he lay
at Margaret’s feet. In a trice he had severed the
head of her mortal enemy, and upon his knee he
offered the ghastly trophy to his Queen. “Madam,”
he said, “the war is over; here is the King’s
ransom!” The Queen turned sick at the terrible
sight, and hysterically sobbed and laughed alterna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>tely,
and she screamed aloud when soldiers stuffed the
blood-dripping head into a common chaff-sack. Lord
Clifford she knighted on the spot, using his own
gory sword; then she ordered York’s head to be
carried off to York, and placed on the city’s southern
gateway.</p>

<p>Salisbury was also <i>hors de combat</i>, wounded and
a prisoner, and by the Queen’s orders he was beheaded
on the field of battle,&mdash;for he would not yield his
sword and word,&mdash;and his head was placed by the side
of his leader’s. In a moment, too, of justifiable
vengeance, the Queen directed that space should be
left on that carrion portal for two other traitors’
heads&mdash;Warwick’s and March’s. “There,” she said,
“they all four shall dangle till the rain and the sun
and the birds have consumed them&mdash;warnings to all
and sundry who shall hereafter raise voice and hand
against their liege.”</p>

<p>Margaret pushed south, and at St. Albans, on
February 17, met Warwick, with the King in his
camp. The issue was soon decided; 2,000 Yorkists
were slain, and Henry and Margaret were united
once more. Lord Montague discovered him alone
seated under a tree. Clifford galloped off to the
Queen to tell her the good news, and, bereft of kirtle
and veil and every sign of royalty, she rushed as she
was to where the King was awaiting her. He bade
her kneel before he embraced her, and gave her
then and there the knightly accolade, as well as to
his son, who had run as hard as he could after his
mother, and he also knighted sixty worthy, loyal
gentlemen. All entered the abbey church for <i>Te Deum</i>
and Benediction, and then the royal pair sought the
monastery for rest and food. Leaving Henry at <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>his
devotions, and the Prince to cheer him, Margaret
again mounted her charger and marched straight on
London, where York’s eldest son, Edward, Earl of
March, a lad of eighteen, had been proclaimed King
as Edward IV. Perhaps over-confident, and at all
events uncompromising in her intention to punish
the disloyal and rebel citizens, she failed to post her
army advantageously, although she had 60,000 men
against Warwick’s 40,000. At Towton the fates
were once more against her, and she, with the King
and the Prince, fled for their lives to Newcastle, and
over the border to the friendly Court of the Queen
Regent, Margaret. Henry was established in royal
state at Kirkcudbright, and the Queen and Prince at
Dunfermline, and there the little fellow, just eight
years of age, was betrothed to the young King’s
sister, Margaret.</p>

<p>Margaret was really happy in her new home, and,
resourceful as she was and never cast down, she
turned her attention to peaceful pursuits, and in particular
interested herself in the local industry of
wool-weaving. She had seen her father’s and her
mother’s interest, in her happy days in Lorraine and
Anjou, in the craftsmen and craftswomen about
them, and her own skilful fingers had busied themselves
in homely, peaceful avocations. Margaret
endeared herself to her Fifeshire friends, as she
usually did to all who were fortunate enough to be
thrown into contact with her, and they sang of
her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“God bless Margaret of Anjou,</div>
<div class="verse">For she taught Dunfermline how to sew.”</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was said, too, of Margaret, that “if she had
not been destined to play the rôle of Bellona, she
would have glorified that of Minerva.” The Earl of
March,&mdash;to whom she never allowed the style of
Edward IV.,&mdash;was wont to repeat his quaint joke:
“Margaret is more to be feared when a fugitive
than all the leaders of Lancaster put together!”</p>

<p>On April 16, 1462, Queen Margaret bade adieu to
her consort at Kirkcudbright, and with her son and
suite, in four well-found Scottish galleys, set sail for
France. She landed at Ecluse in Brittany, after
more perils on the sea, and was cordially welcomed
by Duke Francis, who gave her 12,000 <i>livres</i>.
Thence she made straight to Chinon,&mdash;of happy
memories,&mdash;to interview King Louis, who had just
been crowned at Reims, upon the death of his father,
Charles VII. There she was folded in the loving
arms of her dear aunt, Queen Marie; and what a
meeting that was for both royal ladies! They had
not seen each other since that auspicious wedding-day
sixteen years before. Then they were both in
the heyday of prosperity; now both were crushed by
Providence&mdash;Marie flouted by her ill-conditioned,
jealous daughter-in-law, Charlotte de Savoy, now
Queen-consort of France, and Margaret a fugitive!</p>

<p>Louis played a double game&mdash;a cruel one indeed,
and insincere so far as Margaret was concerned. He
spoke to her fairly, but his mind was with the usurping
King of England. Under one pretext or another
he delayed his reply to her plea for assistance, but at
length, in desperation, Margaret pledged Jersey with
him for 2,000 French bowmen. King René was in
Provence, but, taking a hint from Louis that his
presence would be undesirable just then in Anjou, he
sent for his daughter to join him at Aix. This was
impossible; for Margaret time was all too valuable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
and she set sail for Scotland on October 10. With
her went a few single-hearted knights, but of all the
hosts of admirers and loyal followers of sixteen years
before, only one of mark wore his badge of chivalry
consistently&mdash;the gallant and accomplished Pierre de
Brézé, a <i>preux chevalier</i> indeed, the forerunner of
Bayart, and like him “<i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>.”</p>

<p>Again the elements were not only unpropitious,
but malevolent. Escaping the vigilance of Edward’s
cruisers, and the rebel guns of Tynemouth, basely
trained upon their Queen, her ships were wrecked
on Holy Island. There 500 of her troops were
massacred, and Margaret and de Brézé, and a very
meagre following, put to sea in a fisherman’s open
boat which landed them on Bamborough sands. The
banner of Henry of Lancaster, once more raised
aloft by Margaret, magnet-like drew all the
northern counties, and in spite of Somerset’s desertion
the Queen soon found herself at the head of
a formidable army, with the King beside her and the
Prince. Once more at Hexham fickle fortune failed
the intrepid Queen. Henry was again a captive, but
Margaret and Edward made good their escape over
the Scottish border.</p>

<p>How often, when human affairs appear most
desperate, and all hope and effort are thrown away,
help comes from some unexpected quarter! So it
was in Queen Margaret’s experience. There is a
romantic tale with respect to her flight from Hexham’s
stricken field&mdash;the story of the robber.
Whether one or more outlaws waylaid and robbed
the fugitives it matters not, but, stripped of everything
but the clothes they wore, Queen and Prince
were in dismal straits. Wonder of wonders! a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
messenger followed Margaret from no less a person
than the Duke of Burgundy, the inveterate enemy
of her house, the friend and ally of the English in
France. The message was in effect an invitation to
the Queen and Prince to Flanders&mdash;the splendid
appanage of ducal Burgundy. Margaret’s implacable
foes,&mdash;the winds and seas,&mdash;were waiting for their
prey, and nearly secured their quarry as she tossed
to and fro across the wild North Sea on her way to
meet Philippe. Landing on the Flemish coast on
July 31,&mdash;when storm and tempest should never
have appeared,&mdash;with utmost difficulty, the Queen
presented a sorry figure. No badge or symbol of
royalty marked her worn-out figure; she was clad
meanly in a coarse short worsted skirt&mdash;<i>robette</i>&mdash;without
chemise or shawl, her stockings low down on
her heels, her hair dishevelled and unveiled. Who
could have recognized in that chastened traveller
“the loveliest woman in Christendom”?</p>

<p>True to his loyal devotion, Sieur Pierre de Brézé
was with his Queen poor as herself, he had, he
said, “spent 50,000 crowns for nothing”&mdash;and a
faithful valet, Louis Carbonelle, and no more than
seven women-dresses. At once the Duke was
apprised of Margaret’s coming; but, being on a
pilgrimage to Our Lady of Boulogne, he sent his
apologies by Philippe Pot, Seigneur de la Roche
and a Knight of the Golden Fleece, bidding the
Queen welcome, and saying that he would present
his homage to her shortly if she would proceed direct
to Bruges.</p>

<p>That progress was a nightmare, an “Inferno,” a
masquerade&mdash;what you will: the Queen of Englan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>d
clad in rags, her hair untied, seated in a common
country bullock-cart, drawn by a pair of sorry steeds,
mocked all the way along as “<i>Une Merrie Mol!</i>”
“<i>Une Naufragée!</i>” “<i>Une Sorcière de Vent!</i>” The
Comte de Charolois, heir to the duchy, met her
Majesty at the <i>digue</i>, saluted her with all reverence,
and conducted her to the Castle of St. Pol. On the
morrow the Duke of Burgundy arrived, and at once
went to the Queen’s lodgings to pay his homage.
Right in the middle of the street, where Margaret
stood to greet him, with a courtly bow he swept the
ground with the drooping plume of his <i>berretta</i>,
whilst the Queen curtsied in her abbreviated gown
twice majestically. Never was there a finer piece of
royal burlesque enacted!</p>

<p>Margaret caught the Duke by the arm as he was
about to give the kiss of etiquette. “Thanks, my
cousin,” she said; “now I am, perhaps, in no fit
mind for compliments. I seek your aid for Henry
and our son, and I beseech you, by the love of Our
Lady, not to credit the abominable tales which have
been circulated touching me.” The Duke did not
commit himself, but generously gave his “sweet
cousin” 2,000 golden crowns,&mdash;wherewith “to fit
your Majesty with proper raiment,” he said,&mdash;and a
fine diamond to wear for him. The next day the
Duchess of Bourbon, Philippe’s sister, visited Queen
Margaret, and in her she found a sincere and
sympathizing confidante. She set before the Duchess
all the sad facts of her impoverished condition, and
told her all about the hardships she and her spouse
and son had met with in England. “We were
reduced,” she said, “on one occasion to one herring
among three, and not more bread than would suffice
for five days’ nourishment.” She went on to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
that once at Mass, at Dunfermline, she had no coin
for the offertory, and she asked an archer of the
King of Scotland, kneeling near her, for a farthing,
which he most reluctantly gave her.</p>

<p>“Alas!” replied the weeping Duchess, “no Queen
save your Majesty has been so hardly dealt with by
Providence; but now we must offer you, sweet cousin,
some consolation for your sufferings.” One more
affecting speech of the heroic Queen must be recorded.
“When on the day of my espousal,” she said, “I
gathered the rose of England, I was quite well aware
that I should have to wear it whole with all its
thorns!”</p>

<p>The Duchess, true to her word, organized splendid
fêtes at the Castle of St. Pol in honour of the royal
refugees, and Margaret, now attired as became her
lofty station, put on one side her cruel anxieties, and
yielded herself to the pleasures and humours of the
festivities. They put her in mind of the gay tournaments
in her happy home&mdash;the Court of her good
father, King René.</p>

<p>Henry was all the while a prisoner in the Tower,
and Margaret’s tender heart bled on his account.
She for the moment was without resources, and she
had to bide her time. She knew that that time would
come, and never for a moment did she lend herself to
unprofitable despair. The Duke stood by her, a friend
in need, and bestowed both money and an escort upon
his royal visitor. In the spring of 1463 she and the
Prince were welcomed in Bar-le-Duc by King René
and his Court, though it cost Margaret a pang to see
her one-time Maid of Honour, Jehanne de Laval, in
her dear mother’s place.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>
<p>Six months passed all too swiftly under the hospitable
roofs of her brother Jean, Duke of Calabria,
and now actual Duke of Lorraine as well, and of
her sister Yolande, Countess of Vaudémont. Then
widowed Queen Marie sent an urgent summons for
her favourite niece to pay her a visit at Amboise in
Touraine, and there most happily Margaret forgot her
troubles, and looked more hopefully than ever to the
future.</p>

<p>King René’s affairs were in hopeless confusion, and
his interests and resources were drained by his son’s
campaign in Italy. He could offer nothing but a
loving father’s whole-hearted love and protection to his
unfortunate daughter and his little grandson, the
pride and joy of his life. He breathed out his deep
feelings in two elegant canticles eloquent of Margaret’s
woes. His example set all the poets singing
sweetly of the Lancastrian Queen; her beauty and
her accomplishments, her troubles and her fortitude,
appealed to them mightily. They sought, too, to
cheer the riven soul of their liege lord and poet leader:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Rouse thee, King René! rouse thee, good René!</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Let not sorrow all thy spirits beguile.</div>
<div class="verse">Thy dear daughter, brave spouse of King Henry,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Tho’ sadly she wept still she coaxes a smile.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All that René was able to do for his royal daughter
was to establish her and her son at his castle of
Kuerere, near St. Mihil’s by Verdun in Lorraine,
with 2,000 <i>livres</i> to carry on the education of the
Prince. Sir John Fortescue, a soldier of fortune,
was appointed his tutor. He was a devoted adherent
of the Red Rose. “We are,” he wrote, “reduced to
great poverty, and the Queen with difficulty sustaineth
us in meat and drink.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>
<p>Louis XI., who had refused to have anything to do
with his unfortunate cousin, Queen Margaret, at last
agreed to meet her at Tours in December, 1469, and
with her he invited King René; Jean, Duke of
Calabria and Lorraine; and her sister Yolande, with
her husband, Ferri, Count of Vaudémont, “to consider,”
as he put it, “what may or may not be done.”
Louis treated Margaret with scant ceremony. Whilst
discussions were going on, startling news came from
England which very much altered the situation. The
North and Midlands had again risen against Edward,
and Warwick had gone over to the Lancastrians.
Edward was a prisoner at Middleham Castle, and
Warwick was virtually King of England! The
diversion was, however, of short duration, for in a
few weeks Edward managed to escape. And now it
was Warwick’s turn to fly. He sought the French
Court, and confided in Louis, who, sinister and
scheming as he was always, saw a way to help
Margaret and still be on the winning side. The
King proposed an interview between the Queen and
the Earl, with a view to a reconciliation. Margaret
rejected indignantly the proposal. “The Earl of
Warwick,” she exclaimed, “has pierced my heart
with wounds that can never be healed. They will
bleed till the Day of Judgment. He hath done
things which I can never forgive.”</p>

</div>

<p>The King was, however, determined that his idea
of a <i>rapprochement</i> between the Lancastrians and
the wing of the Yorkists who looked to Warwick for
light and leading should be realized, and he urged his
view so emphatically upon Margaret that at last she
agreed to meet Warwick, but upon one condition:
that “he shall unsay before your Majesty and the
King of Sicily, my father, all that he has foully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
uttered about me and the Prince, and shall swear to
repeat the same at Paul’s Cross in London later.”</p>

<p>Warwick, to the amazement of Louis, agreed to this
condition, and forthwith presented himself most
humbly to the Queen upon his knees. Swordless,
gloveless, and uncovered, he sought pardon for his
evil conduct, and prayed her to accept him as her true
henchman and devoted lieutenant. Margaret seemed
stunned by this extraordinary <i>volte-face</i>, and kept the
Earl upon his knees quite a long time before she
vouchsafed a reply. At last she extended her hand
for him to kiss, and he, further, servilely kissed the fur
hem of her robe. Then he laid his plans before the
august company for releasing the King and placing
him once more upon his throne. He next called on
King Louis and King René to stand surety for the
performance of his purpose. He said he could command
immediately 50,000 men to fight under his
orders, and he craved the presence of the Queen in
the saddle by his side.</p>

<p>With Warwick was the Earl of Oxford and other
leaders of his party, who all knelt in homage to the
Queen and craved her clemency. To Oxford she at
once extended her hand. “Your pardon, my lord,”
she said, “is right easy. What wrongs you have done
me are cancelled by what you have borne for King
Henry.” The conference at Tours was adjourned,
and resumed at the Castle of Angers; and then
Louis had another startling proposition to lay before
Queen Margaret: no less than the betrothal of Prince
Edward,&mdash;now a well-grown and handsome lad of
seventeen,&mdash;to the Earl of Warwick’s daughter
Anne! Margaret flared up at once. “Impossible!”
she said. “What! will he indeed give his daug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>hter
to my royal son, whom he has so often branded as
the offspring of adultery or fraud! By God’s name,
that can never be!”</p>

<p>For a whole fortnight Margaret stood her ground.
She could not agree to this extraordinary proposal;
but then the peaceful, fatherly insistence of René
caused her to relent, but not before she roundly rated
her good sire for his pusillanimity and too ready
credence. Meanwhile the Countess of Warwick and
her daughter had arrived at Amboise, and had been
most ostentatiously received by King Louis. Then
happened, by happy coincidence, an event vastly
important to the King of France&mdash;the birth of an
heir. Queen Charlotte was delivered of a son, the
future Charles VIII., on June 30. Nothing would
content the King but Prince Edward and Anne
Neville must be among the child’s sponsors. At the
same time, to influence Queen Margaret, Warwick, at
Louis’s suggestion, made a solemn asseveration in the
cathedral church of Angers: “Upon this fragment of
the True Cross I promise to be true to King Henry VI.
of England; to Queen Margaret, his spouse; and to
the Prince of Wales, his true and only son; and to go
back at once to England, raise 50,000 men, and
restore the King to his honours.” Louis gave him
46,000 gold crowns and 2,000 French archers, and at
the same time asked Queen Margaret to accept the
charge of his young daughter Anne whilst he was
away.</p>

<p>Margaret could not stand out any longer, and so,
immediately after the baptismal ceremony,&mdash;where
she herself held her little royal nephew at the font,&mdash;Edward,
Prince of Wales, and Anne Neville were
betro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>thed with gorgeous ceremonial in the Chapel of
St. Florentin, within the Castle of Amboise, in the
presence of nearly all the Sovereigns of France and
their Courts.</p>

<p>“The Prince,” so said the chroniclers, “is one of the
handsomest and most accomplished Princes in Europe,
tall, fair like his mother, and with her soft voice and
courteous carriage, was well pleased with his pretty
and sprightly fiancée.” People sought to belittle the
match, and called it a <i>mésalliance</i>; but the bride’s
great-grandmother was Joanna Beaufort, daughter
of Prince John of Ghent, Edward III.’s third son.
She married the Earl of Westmoreland. In Queen
Margaret’s estimation, what certainly did weigh
very considerably was the fact that her daughter-in-law-to-be
was one of the wealthiest heiresses in
England. The august company went on to Angers
after the double ceremony, at the desire of Queen
Margaret, who insisted that a Prince of Wales could
only be married in his ancestral dominions. She
cited the intention of King René to leave to her and
her heirs the duchy of Anjou, and so she claimed
it as already English territory. Louis acceded to
her whim. He could afford to wait and watch the
course of events. The marriage of Prince Edward
and the Lady Anne was consequently solemnized, on
August 15, in the Cathedral of St. Maurice, which
had witnessed so many royal functions.</p>

<p>The Earl of Warwick, accompanied by the Duke
of Clarence, grandson of King Henry IV., departed
immediately for England, to make good his brave
words and prove his loyalty. His proclamation in
favour of Henry, Margaret, and Edward, produced
an immense sensation, and in a couple of days he
found himself in command of 70,000 men, all crying,
“A Henry! A Henry!” Edward IV. immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
left the capital and sought the friendly shores of
Holland, and Warwick was, without a blow being
struck, master of the kingdom. His first step was
to send the Bishop of Winchester to the Tower, to
clothe King Henry in regal robes, and conduct him
with the Sovereign’s escort to the Palace of Westminster.
On October 13 the King went to St. Paul’s,
wearing once more his crown. Louis ordered <i>Te
Deum</i> to be sung in every church in France, and
went in person to the Castle of Saumur to salute
Queen Margaret. Early in November the Queen,
with the Prince and Princess of Wales and a very
distinguished following, set out for Paris, on their
way to London. Every town through which the
royal cortège passed was gaily decorated, and the
hearty plaudits of the thronging inhabitants were
mingled with the joy peals of all the bells.</p>

<p>Harfleur once more was fixed upon as the port
of passage, and once more the Channel churned and
a tempest fell upon the royal flotilla. Nobody has
been able to explain why Margaret of England was
so persistently persecuted by the divinities of the
weather. Twice they put back to port, and then,
after tossing about for sixteen whole days and nights,
they made Weymouth,&mdash;a passage ordinarily of no
more than as many hours,&mdash;and landed on April 13.
That day was indeed ill-omened for the cause Queen
Margaret had at heart, and for which she had suffered
such appalling vicissitudes. The Battle of Barnet
was fought and lost; Warwick was killed, and King
Henry was again a prisoner. Verily, Queen Margaret’s
star was a blaze of disasters!</p>

<p>The terrible news staggered the courageous Queen;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
she swooned, but soon recovered her usual equanimity,
although out of the bitterness of her soul she sobbed:
“Better die right out, methinks, than exist so insecurely!”
She appeared to have no plan of action,
for such a disaster seemed to be impossible; so, to
gain time for thought and effort, she moved herself
and those she loved into the safe sanctuary of Beaulieu
Abbey. There Somerset and many other notable
fugitives forgathered. To them she counselled retreat&mdash;“Till
Providence,” she said, “ordereth better luck.”
The Prince now for the first time asserted himself,
and, with his mother’s daring, gave an emphatic “No.”
At Bath a goodly array of soldiers rallied to the
royal standard, and Margaret determined to cross the
Severn and join her forces to Jasper Tudor’s army
of sturdy loyal Welshmen. The Duke of Gloucester
opposed her advance, and so she turned aside to
Tewkesbury, and there encamped.</p>

<p>The morrow (May 4, 1471) was to be the darkest
in all the chequered career of Margaret of Anjou
and England. Sweet Pentecost though it was, the
spirit of comfort belied, failed the fated Queen once
more. With early dawn fell aslant the springtide
sunbeams a rain of feathered hail. Battle was joined,
each man at his post&mdash;save one, the perjured Lord
Wenlock. His command, in the centre of Queen
Margaret’s forces, lacked its leader, and Somerset
rode off to find him. At a low brothel he discovered
the miscreant drinking with and fondling loose
wenches. “Traitor!” cried the Duke; “die, thou
scoundrel!” And he clove his head in two. This
defection caused irretrievable disaster; still, the
Prince of Wales did prodigies of valour, and so did
many more; but he was felled from his horse, and

victorious Edward’s tent. Received with every
mark of discourtesy, the heart of the chivalrous
young Prince must have quailed as he stood before
the arch-enemy of his house, but he had very little
time for reflection.</p>

<p>“How durst thou, changeling, presumptuously
enter my dominions with banners displayed against
me?” demanded Edward.</p>

<p>“To recover my father’s crown, the heritage of
my ancestors,” bravely replied the Prince.</p>

<p>“Speakest thou thus to me, thou upstart! See,
I smite thee on thy bastard mouth!” roughly exclaimed
the conqueror, and with that he demeaned
himself and the crown he fought for by cowardly
and savagely striking with his mailed fist the unsuspecting
and unarmed Prince. This treacherous blow
was the signal to the titled scoundrels standing by
for a murderous attack upon the Prince of Wales.
He fell crying fearlessly: “A Henry! A Henry!”
pierced by many daggers. It was a dark deed and
dastardly; its stain no course of years will ever cleanse,
and Edward IV. is for all time “Bloody Edward.”</p>

<p>Queen Margaret, seeing the hopelessness of the
conflict, and fearing the worst had happened to the
Prince,&mdash;for he never came to cheer her,&mdash;took the
Princess and fled to a convent hard by the battlefield,
and there lay concealed. Edward, yielding to
the base instincts of a cruel nature, very soon got
news of Margaret’s hiding-place, and with a demoniacal
scowl, “Ah, ah!” he cried out, “we’ve settled
the cub; now for the she-wolf!”</p>

<p>The Queen was dragged from her hiding-place,
and borne to Edward’s quarters, where, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
brute he was, he reviled and insulted her.</p>

<p>“Slay me, thou bloodthirsty wretch, if thou wilt!
I care not for death at thy desecrating hands! May
God strike thee, as He will!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Margaret was sent to the Tower, but not to her
husband; they were kept apart, and the Princess of
Wales was delivered over to the care of her uncle, the
Archbishop of York. But even so Edward’s malice
was not exhausted. The Queen was conducted without
honour, or even decency, in the suite of Edward
on his return to the capital. At Coventry,&mdash;of all
places for further outrage, a place so greatly agreeable
to Henry and herself,&mdash;ill-fated Margaret was
subjected to personal insults from her vanquisher.
In reply she reviled him, and thrust him with abhorrence
from her. In revenge he ordered her to be
fastened upon a common sumpter horse, and he
ordered a placard to be placed on her breast,
“This is Queen Margaret, good lieges,” and her
hands were tied behind her back. Thus was the
most valiant, most unselfish, and most loyal Queen
that England ever had led to grace the mock
triumph of a royal murderer. She was thrust into
the foulest dungeon of the grim Tower, and there
remained, bereft of food, of service, and wellnigh of
reason, too, for seven dreary, weary months.</p>

<p>The day after her incarceration King Henry’s
dead body was discovered in his cell. Gloucester,
it was said, had killed him; but Edward was, if
not the actual murderer, privy to the deed. Queen
Margaret, hearing in her dark, foul den the heavy
tramp of men-at-arms, scrambled up to the bars
of her little window, and beheld,&mdash;what probably
Edward meant she should,&mdash;the corpse of her slaughtered
husband borne past for burial. No ceremony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
of any kind accompanied that mournful passing. At
St. Paul’s, Henry’s body was exposed in a chapel
of the crypt, and then it found merciful sepulture in
the God’s-acre at Chertsey Abbey.</p>

<p>That her beloved son,&mdash;her one and only hope,&mdash;was
dead as well, heart-broken Margaret gathered
amid ribald blasphemies of the intoxicated soldiery as
she was borne to London in that “Triumph.” Now
was she bereft indeed, and nothing seemed so desirable
as death; indeed, she resigned herself, and prepared
herself for execution at any moment, at any
savage hint of her consort’s supplanter on England’s
throne&mdash;accursed Edward! It was, however, not to
be supposed that King Louis of France or King
René of Sicily-Anjou should silently condone the
unhalting cruelty of a bloodthirsty monarch, especially
when the person and the honour of a French Princess
were at stake.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Efforts were made, more or less feeble, for the
delivery of the incarcerated Queen by Louis,&mdash;fearful
of offence to the Yorkist King,&mdash;and by René, who
had no resources with which to back up his appeal.
Anyhow, Margaret was, at the Christmas following
the fatal battle, released from durance vile, and consigned
to the care of the Duchess-Dowager of
Somerset,&mdash;one of her earliest friends,&mdash;and went to
live under her wing at Wallingford. Edward made
her the beggarly grant of 5 marks weekly for the
support of herself and two maid-servants! There
Margaret remained for five years, each one more
intolerable than its predecessor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>
<p>At the Peace of Picquigny, August 29, 1475,
between Louis and Edward, the latter agreed to
accept a ransom of 50,000 gold crowns for the
widowed Queen. This compact was not an act of
grace on the part of Louis so much as a <i>quid pro
quo</i>. He insisted upon René ceding Provence to the
crown of France, upon his death, by way of payment
of the ransom. Still, in this matter Edward was as
good as his bond, and directly the first instalment of
the amount was paid in London to John Howard,
Edward’s Treasurer, Margaret was conducted to Sandwich,
not without indignity, and placed upon a
common fishing-boat. Landing at Dieppe, January
14, 1476, she was taken on to Rouen, where she
received the following affecting letter from her
sorrowing father, King René:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Ma fille, que Dieu vous assiste dans vos conseils,
car c’est rarement des hommes qu’il faut en attendre
dans les revers de fortune. Lorsque vous désirerez
moins ressentir vos peines, pensez aux miennes; elles
sont grandes, ma fille, et pourtant je vous console.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_A_10" id="FNanchor_A_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_10" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_10" id="Footnote_A_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_10"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> “My child, may God assist thee in thy counsels, for rarely do
men render help in times of fortune’s reverses. When you desire
to resent your trials the least, think of mine; they are great, my
child, and therefore I wish to console you.”</p>

</div>

<p>True enough, the troubles and reverses of King
René were more than fall to the lot of most men of
high culture and degree; but what of Queen Margaret’s
shipwreck? For nearly thirty years she had endured
experiences which had tried no other Queen half so
hardly; and all the while she had set a unique
example of devotion, loyalty, courage, and endurance,
unexampled in history. There never was a truer
wife, a more self-sacrificing mother, a more intre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>pid
and a nobler Queen, than Margaret of Anjou.</p>

<p>From Rouen the Queen sent a message to King
Louis, desiring to see him; but he, knowing well her
desperate case, and seeing no likelihood of profit
accruing to himself, coward-like, evaded an interview.
His miserable aunt might forage for herself, for all
he cared, and go where she listed, but not to Paris
nor Amboise. With bent head and slow feet, the
great heroine of the Wars of the Roses, broken like
a pitcher at a fountain, took her lonely way no more
in gallant cavalcade, but almost in funereal cortège,
to Anjou and Angers&mdash;the cradle of her race.</p>

<p>At Reculée father and daughter once more
embraced each other. Alas, what a sorrowful meeting
that was, and how mixed their feelings!
Margaret’s filial duty conquered the reproaches she
had prepared, and René’s tears and silence spoke
more loudly than words of regret could do. Providence
had been cruel to them both. René loved
Reculée for its peace and solitude, and there Margaret
should repose awhile and recover mind and body.
No prettier resort was there in all Anjou than the
Maison de Reculée&mdash;“Reculée” René named it, a
place of “recoil” from the buffetings of fate. He
had purchased the estate, in 1465, from one Colin, an
Angers butcher, for 300 <i>écus d’or</i>, and had greatly
enjoyed laying out the estate and erecting a bijou
residence. His paintings and his sculptures, his
books, his music scores, his miniatures, and all his
artistic hobbies, he lavished there for himself and fair
Queen Jehanne. They often dropped down the
Maine in a pleasure barge, and landed in the sedges,
full of warblers and wild life. Reculée was but a
league or two from Angers. Hard by the <i>manoir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></i>
was the sheltered and picturesque hermitage of La
Baumette,&mdash;a shrine of St. Baume, patroness of
Provence,&mdash;and hither René and Margaret resorted
daily for prayer and meditation.</p>

<p>Margaret’s home-coming was sad enough, but her
demeanour was rather that of defiance than of
patience. Her pride had been laid low by her sufferings
and ill-treatment, but not slain; and when she
heard of the treachery and chicanery of the King of
France in entering Angers in force, and proclaiming
himself Sovereign of Anjou, her scorn knew no
bounds, and she chided her father for his pusillanimity,
and reproached him for his <i>dilettante</i> life. His
sedentary pleasures and his artistic tastes bored her
cruelly; she despised his peaceful handiwork, and
craved his strong arm once more in the fight. If
England was lost to her, Anjou and Provence should
not be; this was her grim determination, and she
roused herself for action and foray. Like a lioness at
bay, she fought out to a finish strenuously her troubled
life, away from stricken fields and gruesome dungeons.
René felt his daughter’s strictures more acutely than
he said; indeed, they fell like blows of sharp poniards
upon his wounded heart. The deaths of all his near
relatives, sons and daughters, and his son-in-law,
Ferri de Vaudémont, saddening as they were, were
as nothing to the vituperations of Margaret&mdash;now
almost a frenzied recluse. King René sank at last,
wearied, heart-broken, yet trustful in his God, into
his mortal resting-place, and Queen Margaret retired
to the Castle of Dampière, near Saumur, the modest
<i>manoir</i> of a devoted servant of her father’s house,&mdash;the
Sieur François de la Vignolles, of Moraens,&mdash;to
end her dire days of woe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Her father left her what he could, impoverished
as he was: 1,000 gold crowns and the Castle of
Queniez&mdash;an inconsiderable estate between Angers
and Saumur. René wrote to Louis a few months
before his death, commending Margaret to his care
and charity, and this is how the King of France
executed the trust, so characteristic of his greed and
cunning. He negotiated with Margaret the sale of
her reversionary rights in Lorraine, Anjou, Maine,
Provence, and Barrois, for an annual income of
600 <i>livres</i>. The deed was executed at Reculée,
November 19, 1480, but Louis never paid the
annuity! One purpose Margaret had in view in this
arrangement was the recovery of the bodies of her
husband and son, that she might give them decent
burial. Edward IV. would not allow this seemly
duty, and the bones of the illustrious dead were left
dishonoured and unnoted.</p>

<p>Margaret’s nature would not allow of comfort.
She was devoured with regret and consumed by
revenge; she spent the last two years of her stormy
life in fretting and fuming over the disasters of her
family. Her whole appearance and her manner
changed. No longer lovely, as when she stepped on
England’s inhospitable shore, she became shrunk,
aged, and pallid. The ravenings of her spirit had
indeed transformed her into the “grim grey wolf of
Anjou.” She became leprous and hideous&mdash;“the
most hideous Princess in Europe,” one might write.
Gently but firmly she had to be restrained, lest she
should do herself some harm and injure others.
Alas! Margaret of Anjou came to her death, not in
the halo of sanctity, but in the mist of mental
obscurity, and thus she died alone&mdash;perhaps <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>unlamented,
and certainly misjudged by posterity.
Near her end languor and paralysis seized her, and
she passed away unconsciously on August 25, 1482.</p>

<p>Above the chief portal of his castle De la Vignolles
put up this epitaph:</p>

<p>“In the year 1480 Margaret of Anjou and Queen
of England, daughter of René, King of Naples, Sicily,
and Jerusalem, forced to abandon her kingdom after
having courageously borne herself in a great number
of encounters and in twelve pitched battles, deprived
of the rights of her family, spoiled of all her possessions,
without means of support and without help,
found a resting-place in this <i>manoir</i>, the home of
François de la Vignolles, an old and faithful servant
of her father. She died here August 25, 1482, aged
no more than fifty-three years. Upon whose soul
may Christ Jesus have pity.”</p>

<p>All that remained of this remarkable woman was
interred without ceremony in the Cathedral of
Angers. She was laid, it was said, by her father’s
side, but no inscription, no mark of any kind, records
the fact. No one knows exactly where to bow the
head in reverence and bend the knee in homage to the
memory of Great Queen Margaret. In a very few
words, however, are summed up in the “Paston
Letters,” No. 275, the character of Margaret
d’Anjou: “The Queen is a grete and stronge
laborid woman, for she spareth noo peyne to save
hir things.”</p>

<span class="smaller">JEHANNE DE LAVAL&mdash;“THE LADY OF THE CREST”</span></h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>There are roses at Christmas as well as at midsummer,
and although the pale single blossoms of the
winter festival have not the fragrance of the floral
queens of the month of May, they are roses all the
same. All roses, though, have thorns, or their petals
are crinkled and their leaves torn. In the Temple
Gardens, as the story goes, once on a time two rival
warriors met, and plucked, one a white, and one a red,
rose from the bushes. They stuck them in their
caps, and so carried them to battle, fierce and long&mdash;the
deadly Wars of the Roses. The story of the
rose heroine of those troubled scenes, the intrepid
Queen Margaret, we have learnt; now we must read
the narrative of another Queen of Roses, La Demoiselle
Jehanne de Laval, and of her nigh fifty-years-old
bridegroom, le bon Roy René, a Christmas rose.</p>

<p>“May and December” we call such nuptials. But
never mind. The monarch and the maid went very
well together, and for them literally came true, “Roses,
roses, all the way.” He the great red standard rose
of Provence, she the nestling, creeping, sweet wild-rose
of Laval, mingled their renown and charm for
the pleasure of all ages.</p>

</div>

<p>Jehanne, or Jeanne, de Laval, “a very beautiful
woman and superbly dressed”&mdash;this is a succinct and
alluring description of one of the most fascinating
beauties, as lovely in mind as in body, be it said,
who ever took her gracio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>us path across the pages of
sentimental biography. Born at the Castle of Auray,&mdash;of
which now not a stone is standing,&mdash;in Brittany,
overlooking the tempestuous Atlantic and the Druid
fable-land of Carnac-Locmariaker, on November 10,
1433, Jehanne was the fifth child of Guy XIII.,
Count of Laval, and his wife, Isabelle de Bretagne,
whose father was Jean VI., Duke of Brittany,
and mother Princess Joanna of France, sister of
Charles VII. The House of Laval was very famous
in the annals of mediæval France, and linked by
auspicious marriages to all the Sovereign Princes of
the land. The first Count was a Baron of Charlemagne&mdash;a
“Guy,” the unalterable prenominate of all
the line. Their castle was founded by that King of
romance and chivalry, King Arthur, and each succeeding
occupant made good his claim to the gilded spurs
of knighthood either on a stricken field or in a
crusade to Palestine; they were war-lords all. Laval
was their principal stronghold, midway between
Rennes and Le Mans, where the machicolated
donjon of the Seigneurs of La Trémouille, upon its
isolated rock, dominates the smiling country-side.</p>

<p>The full title of the lordly Guys was Counts of
Laval, Vitré, Gaure, and Montfort&mdash;all in Brittany.
Count Guy XIII. had ten children by his consort
Isabelle: Guy, who succeeded him as Guy XIV.;
Pierre, Duke and Archbishop of Reims; Yolande,
sponsored by Queen Yolande of Sicily-Anjou, and
twice married, last to Charles of Anjou, King René’s
brother; Françoise, who only survived her birth
fourteen days; Jehanne, or Jeanne; Anne, died in
infancy; Artuse, who died unmarried at Marseilles
in 1467; Hélène, wife of Jehan de Malestroit, son of
the Bishop of Nantes by his mistress, Isabel Kaër;
and Louise, who married Edward, Count of Penthièv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>re.
Guy XIII., inconsolable for the loss of the
mother of his children, sought comfort in another
matrimonial venture, and for his second wife took
Françoise, daughter of Jacques de Dinan, Seigneur
of Châteaubriant and Grand Butler at the Court of
King Charles VI. She bore him three children,&mdash;Pierre,
François, and Jacques,&mdash;so Jehanne was a
member of a large and, we may presume, a happy
family. Little Jehanne was baptized in the Audience
Hall of the Castle of Auray by Amaury de la Motte,
Bishop of Vannes.</p>

<p>There is rarely very much to record of the early
years of any girl’s life, and Jehanne de Laval was no
exception. A maiden was only made conspicuous by
an early betrothal, and for that her parents worked
assiduously. Jehanne was an exception to the rule
of precocious marriages, for no one appears to have
claimed her hand and heart until she was past her
majority, and suitors probably regarded her as a
negligible quantity. Jehanne, however, was not
wanting in her <i>entrée</i> upon the world of men and
manners, and we make her acquaintance when not
more than fourteen years of age, as she comes forward
curvetting upon a <i>blanche haquenée</i> at a royal
tournament.</p>

<p>This was King René’s Anjou tournament, famous,
with those in Lorraine and Provence, as the most
brilliant ever seen in France. The “Lists” in the
Anjou tournament were held in turn at Angers,
Chinon, and Saumur, and it was at the latter gathering
of chivalry, in 1446, that every knight and squire,
every dame and damsel, turned in amazement as they
beheld “a very young girl of most graceful shape
and bearing, covered with a thin veil, and wearin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>g
silken garments sparkling with precious stones, riding
most easily up to the tribune of honour.” The
colours of her habit were blue and white&mdash;blue, as
tender as her eyes; white, fair as her skin. The
reins and crupper of her palfrey were decked with
ribbons, blue and white, and he bore nodding feathers
upon his head-piece. At each side walked her
brothers Guy and Pierre, decked, too, in Laval
colours, the most good-looking and best dressed of
all the pages, holding the horse’s snaffle. By way of
suite there rode behind Jehanne de Laval,&mdash;for such
was the beauteous maiden’s name,&mdash;four maids of
honour, each one a comely feature of a picture
pageant. Amid exclamations of admiration and
most pleasant greetings, the charming cavalcade described
the circuit of the festival ground, and then its
“Queen” leaped lightly to her feet, and, advancing
to the royal stand, made curtsies to the Queens of
Sicily and France, and to Charles and René, their
royal consorts.</p>

<p>Young knights and old came flocking round the
“Fairy Queen,” and she, naïve and winsome, cast
furtive glances here and there, until her bonnie blue
eyes fastened themselves upon the young Count of
Nevers, and he delightedly stepped forth to cavalier
her to her seat amid the throng of beauty and fair
fame upon the ladies’ seats of honour. He was still
<i>a parti</i> in spite of his rejection as suitor for the hand
of Princess Margaret, and his handsome looks and
gallant bearing stood him in good stead where
amorous maidens forgathered. King René,&mdash;ever
susceptible to female charms, both of mind and body,&mdash;did
not behold the fair Demoiselle de Laval unmoved;
he had a tender spot in his great loving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
heart for any attractive damsel; what healthy-minded
man has not? He could not know that that
pretty, clever hand, which so skilfully managed her
curvetting cob, would one day take his in hers for
better, and not for worse!</p>

<p>The coming of young Jehanne de Laval to the
tournament at Saumur provided the sensation of the
day’s exploits. The highest honour, which the
assembled knights before the encounters in the
“Lists” began could confer, was hers by universal
acclamation. She was to be the lady bearer of the
champion’s crest, and, as “Queen of Queens,” to
affix the coveted guerdon of victory upon the helm
of the most successful knight. This election was
preceded by a characteristic observance, true to the
pure spirit of chivalry. Each knight had to kneel
before an altar for the blessing of his weapons, and
for the mental registration of his suffrage for the
“Queen.” She was “the lady of his thought.” So,
certainly, the beauteous apparition of the young
daughter of Guy de Laval caused many a misgiving
in the hearts of gallant men. The “Lady” each had
chosen none divulged by name, but, all the same,
Cupid had done so to the ears of curious friends
and foes. The wholesale desertion of their chosen
divinities might very well account for hard looks and
frowns from emulous maidens:&mdash;all we know, is not
gold that glitters!</p>

<p>The precious <i>gage d’amour et de guerre</i>, the
champion’s crest, took the form of a small gold
crown, heavily jewelled, from which sprang, retained
by wires of gold, three pure white curled feathers of
the crested heron. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>It was awarded to the knight
whose bearing in the “Lists” had been the most
gallant, and whose victories over adversaries had
been most effective, and who had thereby gained the
unanimous votes of the tournament judges. Other
prizes there were of scarcely less distinction: the
first, a golden lance in miniature, to the knight who administered
the most brilliant blow and in the shortest
time; the second, a rich ruby valued at 1,000 <i>écus
d’or</i>,&mdash;for mounting in his helm,&mdash;for the breaker of
the most lances; and the third, a pure diamond of a
similar value, for him who lasted out the longest
before being vanquished by his opponent’s lance.</p>

<p>The “Bringing in the Champion’s Crest” was a
remarkably pretty ceremony. The “Queen of
Beauty,” attended by two maids of honour, all clad
in full state robes, with towering <i>hennins</i>, and wearing
superb jewels and ornaments, were escorted to a
chamber of preparation, within the castle, immediately
before the closing banquet of the tournament.
There a procession was marshalled; pages of the
contestant knights, arrayed in their proper colours
and wearing ermine mantles, danced gaily before the
“Queen of Beauty,” and knelt as she advanced,
bearing the flashing crest upon an embroidered scarf.
Pursuivants, heralds, and kings-of-arms, swelled the
glittering progress with tabards, wands, and crowns.
Masters of the ceremony were in attendance on the
“Queen.” All moved with grace and dignity to the
banqueting-hall, which they traversed up to the royal
daïs, accompanied by attendants bearing great flaring
torches and waxen candles. Everybody rose at the
entry of the procession, and the Prince of highest
rank handed the “Queen” to her special seat, whence
she might receive the homage of the knightly company,
and bestow upon the champion the crest she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
bore. Strident music and the blare of brazen horns
filled the great hall, and the high-pitched roof re-echoed
the plaudits of the company.</p>

<p>The “Grand Prix” was gained neither by King
René nor by King Charles. The former, indeed, caused
a sensation by appearing in black tournament
armour, his shield studded with silver spangles; his
lance was black, and his charger caparisoned in a
black housing, which trailed the ground. René was
mourning still for his good mother, Queen Yolande,
and for his second son of promise rare, Louis,
Marquis of Pont-à-Mousson. The “Champion of
Champions” was not the Count of Nevers,&mdash;perhaps
to Jehanne’s regret,&mdash;but Louis de Beauvau; whilst
the second prize fell to Robert de Florigny, and the
third to Ferri de Vaudémont. These famous tournaments
did not lack the assistance by illustration of
painters; Jehannot le Flament,&mdash;better known nowadays
as Jan van Eyck,&mdash;King René’s master at
Bar-le-Duc, was in attendance on his royal pupil,
and painted at least two considerable pictures of the
pageants. Alas! those valuable paintings are lost
to us.</p>

<p>Well, the “Lists” were over, and the world
and his wife resumed their usual avocations, and
Jehanne de Laval went home once more with her
parents, to finish her education and to be provided
with a husband. And now the chroniclers
of such events as matrimony fail us. Very well we
might have expected the announcement of the “Fairy
Queen’s” betrothal immediately after that famous
tournament. But no&mdash;and in vain we search for the
reason. Jehanne was not espoused. Some have
said that Count Guy, seeing King René’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span> unconcealed
admiration for his captivating little daughter, and
bearing to his beloved companion in peace and war
well-worn confidence, conceived a romantic dream.
Queen Isabelle was said to be very delicate. She
might die young, and then Jehanne might be René’s
solace and his love! Whether the King and the
maiden met again and often we do not know. Very
likely indeed they did, for Jehanne and Margaret
d’Anjou were playmates, and Laval was not so very
far from Angers. This is a dream, of course.</p>

<p>There is a touching story which connects Jehanne
de Laval with another Margaret&mdash;Margaret of Scotland,
the virtuous and accomplished spouse of Louis
the Dauphin, and a great favourite with King Charles
and Queen Marie. The unhappy Princess died of
poison at Sarry-le-Château on August 16, 1445&mdash;poison
administered, it was understood, by her unscrupulous
husband. She was only twenty-three
years of age, but had been Dauphiness for eight
years&mdash;years of neglect and cruelty. Among the
suite which gathered around the bonnie Scottish
Princess were young girls, and of these one was
Jehanne de Laval, of whom Margaret made a special
pet, and shared with her her meals and leisure.
Some candies were given to the children by the
Princess, who rejected them as tasting bitter. Margaret,
to allay their mistrust, ate a number, and she
sickened and died. Her last words were: “A curse
on life! Don’t trouble me about it.” This lamentable
cry was drawn from her through the false
aspersions on her honour raked up against her
by her husband. Marriage was indeed a failure to
Margaret of Scotland, for “there was no one she
dreaded,” says de Commines, “like my lord the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
Dauphin.”</p>

<p>The next scene wherein Jehanne de Laval is
recorded to have been a participant was the obsequies
of Queen Isabelle of Sicily-Anjou and Naples.
We may, however, be quite certain that she was not
absent very far what time that excellent Princess was
in Angers attending to the education of her family.
They were all of near age to the daughter of Count
Guy. Yolande d’Anjou was five years her senior,
and Margaret no more than four. Be this as it may,
King René, anyhow, was not very much in Anjou;
his brain and hands were full of warlike things, and
embarrassed by lack of means.</p>

<p>René d’Anjou, King and Duke, the <i>preux chevalier</i>
of all the beautiful women in his dominions, did not
fail to excite feelings of admiration and of a profounder
passion in the pulsating hearts of the amorous women
and girls of Genoa. There he was received with
acclamations by warrior men, and with kisses by
their wives and sweethearts. A foreign Prince,
especially if he had gained renown in love and war,
was always welcomed enthusiastically by the strong-blooded
Ligurians. The customary characteristic
offering of the city,&mdash;a maiden or two of high birth,&mdash;was
at the King’s disposal. Their names, alas! have
not been recorded, but René showed his appreciation
of his host’s magnificent and patriarchal hospitality
by despatching, on November 10, 1447, four splendid
collars of beaten gold, with medallions of himself, to
Tommaso Spinola, Giacomo Fiesco, Tommaso Fregoso,
and Francesco Doria, fathers of his <i>innamorate</i>. The
historians of Genoa all wrote sententiously of the
royal visitor: “Every woman, even the poorest, put
on a new guise,&mdash;pure white raiment,&mdash;in compliment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
to the Holy Maid’s lieutenant, and all wore ornaments
of pure gold in token of their love for her, and for him
their favour. Tournament, dance, and song, made
the city a rare paradise of joy.” The daughters of
Genoa,&mdash;true daughters of Eve,&mdash;ever evoked the
encomiums of all, as the following quaint quintet, in
perhaps dubious parlance, affirms:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On Monday, March 5, 1453, when the Queen’s burial
casket was borne under its silken canopy through the
streets of Angers, twenty fair daughters of Anjou
and the adjoining States strewed white flowers in
the way. Their leader was Jehanne de Laval, now
grown to womanhood, fresh and sweet. She had
loved the lamented Queen, and learned much from
her gentle ways and her heroism, and she grieved for
the bereavement of King René and his children.
Companions in love and comrades in sorrow cling
equally to one another, and those who rejoice together
in the sunshine compassionate each other in the shade.
Pity is the tender veil of Cupid’s favours.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>King René’s grief at the untimely death of his
devoted spouse completely unstrung the man <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>and
disabled the monarch. He gave himself away to
tears and melancholy, from which even the embraces
of his children failed to rouse him. His Ministers
and courtiers viewed the desolation of their Sovereign
with sincere and deep concern, for it threatened to
unnerve him permanently for the arduous duties of
his station. A consultation was held at Angers by
the Barons and nobles of Anjou, Maine, Lorraine,
Barrois, and Provence, with respect to their beloved
Sovereign’s prostration, and a unanimous decision was
reached&mdash;a second marriage with a young consort,
comely, cultivated, and of good fame. A petition
was presented to the King praying him to yield to the
advice of his “right loyal lieges,” that he should look
out for some noble and virtuous “<i>pucelle qui fust à son
gré</i>.” They add: “We have found just such <i>une très
belle fille nommée Jehanne de Laval</i>,&mdash;wise, well-conditioned,
and of adult age,&mdash;and we know that she
is ready to become the spouse of our very good lord.”</p>

<p>The sorrowful King took heart of grace, acceded
to his subjects’ agreeable suggestion, and, knowing
well himself all young Jehanne’s charms, despatched
forthwith a gallant embassy to his old friend, Count
Guy, demanding the hand of his beauteous daughter.
Only one bar appeared to stop the course of true
love,&mdash;for such René’s was for Jehanne,&mdash;the disparity
of age: he was forty-seven, she twenty-two. This
was soon dismissed, and “May” and “December”
were betrothed in the August month of ripe red gold.
Articles of marriage were signed at Angers on September
3, 1455&mdash;by Seigneur de Couldray, Captain of
the Guard; Guy de Laval; Louis de Beauvau; the
Counts of Vendôme and Tancarville; the Seigneur de
Lohere; Raoul de Bosket; and Olivier de Feschal&mdash;whereby
the bride’s <i>dot</i> was fixed at 40,000 <i>écus d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>’or</i>
(<i>circa</i> £2,000). The marriage ceremony was celebrated
at the abbey church of St. Nicholas d’Angers
on September 16 by Cardinal de Foix, Archbishop of
Arles, in the presence of Bishops and deputations
from every part of King René’s dominions. The
wedding ceremony was notable for the appearance of
the bride’s young brother Pierre, a boy of eleven
years of age, habited in full episcopal vestments. He
was nominal Archbishop of Reims and Bishop of
St. Brieux and St. Malo.</p>

<p>The citizens of Angers received their new Queen
“<i>en grant joye et lyesse</i>,” but, notwithstanding the
general satisfaction, the Court became grave and
serious, and, to universal astonishment, there were
neither tournaments for the nobles nor junketings for
the poorer people. The heart of the King was still
sore; he seemed disinclined for festivities, and sought
solitude and devotional exercises; his spirit was
<i>acharné</i>&mdash;sad within him. “Had he,” people asked,
“renounced the pleasures he so loved for ever?”
René found relief from the tension of his feelings in
the composition of a moral allegory which he entitled
“<i>Le Mortefiement de Vaine Plaisance</i>,” which he dedicated
to his confessor, Jean Bernard, Bishop of Tours.
It is by way of being a dialogue between a soul
devoured by love divine and a heart full of earthly
vanities. Other <i>dramatis personæ</i> are introduced at
intervals: “Fear of God;” “Divine Justice;”
“Faith,” “Hope,” and “Sovereign Love,” with “True
Contrition.” Midway in the lengthy poem is a “similitude,”
accompanied by a very beautiful drawing,
showing a Queen,&mdash;perhaps Isabelle,&mdash;seated open-bosomed
in a country waggon, bare-headed, her crown
upon her knees. The two horses are tandem-h<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>arnessed,
the wheeler bestridden by a rider with a thong in hand,
the leader turning sharply round. Thus did René’s
poetic imagination picture his loss and his woe. The
dedication is most touching: “Considering that the
course of life runs like a river, without stopping or
running back, it is necessary to do good deeds to earn
a sweet repose. I set myself to write this book for the
love of the Redeemer, but, that my work may be useful
for all, I tell in plain speech the conflict of the soul and
heart.”</p>

<p>The royal couple left Angers immediately after
their marriage, and spent the month’s honeymoon at
the Castle of Launay les Saumur. Then they set
off for Provence, and reached Arles early in November.
This was the prelude to an entirely new course
of life which King René had in his mind. For thirty
years and more he had courted the smiles of Fortune
in the arena of arms, and she had only given him
frowns. His courage and his chivalry had met with
scant success. Hopes disappointed and finances
wasted, he was a wiser if a poorer man; but now the
residue of his days and enterprises should be differently
expended. Peace has its triumphs as well
as war. Poets and writers, troubadours and musicians,
artists and craftsmen, farmers and sportsmen,
and peasants and fishermen, were peaceful folk; with
such would he throw in his lot&mdash;a <i>roi-patron</i>, a <i>roi-fainéant</i>,
would he be!</p>

<p>The journey to the south was, as usual, by river
barge up the winding sylvan Loire to Roanne, and
thence <i>à portage</i> to Valence, and on by water past
Montelimart, Orange, and Avignon. The King, like
other rulers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span> in France, maintained a fleet of vessels for
trade and pleasure upon the splendid waterways. It
was, of course, a royal progress such as René and
his father and brother, and Queen Yolande, his
venerated mother, had often made, and very cordial
were the greetings by the way. At Arles, where
the King and Queen were rapturously received, they
found awaiting them deputations from every considerable
place in Provence, each bearing goodly offerings
to their liege lord and lady. Arles presented 400
<i>écus d’or</i> in two enamelled gold flasks, and six chased
cups of silver; Aix, two great bowls of silver embossed
and jewelled, six silver cups, and three goblets
of gold; Marseilles, 200 <i>écus d’or</i>, to be spent in
buying fine wax, at the pleasure of the Queen,&mdash;a
treasured possession,&mdash;and four silver cups; Avignon,
twelve enamelled silver cups and two gold goblets;
Tarascon, a great gold ewer and six small goblets&mdash;and
so on. Formalities completed and <i>Te Deum</i>
sung, René and Jehanne went off to Aix, there to
settle and to arrange their household affairs. In
recognition of this auspicious visit to Provence, the
King created his consort Countess of Les Baux, with
proprietary rights in that ancient stronghold.</p>

<p>The ancient family had become extinct in the
comely person of Countess Alix, a helpless girl
placed under the guardianship of her uncle, Robert
de Beaufort, better known as “<i>Le Fléau de Provence</i>,”
the leader of a band of ruffians designated
“<i>Les Tards-Venus</i>.” Fair Alix died unmarried in
1426, and the county of Les Baux passed to
Louis III. d’Anjou, King René’s brother. For
Jehanne de Laval her loving spouse repaired and
decorated the ruinous old castle. The pleasure-grounds
were laid out by René, and the “<i>Pavillon
de la Royne Jehanne</i>” erected, a true “<i>Pavillon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
d’Amour</i>,” wherein he and she could repose and
utter sweet nothings to one another, and revive also
some of the fascinating observances of the once
famous “Court of Love” of Les Baux. Spirits of
former Countess-Presidents of Chapters of the
Troubadours flitted to and fro the “Chamber of the
Rose.” The beauteous if fateful sisters, Étiennette
and Douce, gracious spouses of two fierce rival
Counts, Raymond des Baux and Berenger de Barcelona,
but rivals in the poems and dances of the
troubadours, away in the twelfth century, looked down,
perhaps, from the eerie thrones in “<i>Il Paradiso</i>”
upon the new Queen of Beauty. The girlish figure,
too, of Cécile des Baux, “<i>La Passe Rose</i>,” the fairest
beauty of them all, sought, a century later, the
spiritual companionship of Alix, the last of the
châtelaines, with her to observe the graceful figure of
Queen Jehanne. Memories of lovely women and the
romances of their lives appealed irresistibly to the
royal troubadour; he could picture the gay crowds
in the games of Love. Dark deeds, too&mdash;the clash
of weapons and the stealthy poniard; the smothered
cries from the <i>oubliettes</i>, and the defiant oaths of men
in irons: these the imaginative poet-monarch could
most easily re-create. A thought-moving memento
of a vivid and lurid past was brought to light not
so many years ago in a coffin discovered in the crypt
of the ruined church of St. Catherine&mdash;it was a
woman’s long soft golden hair cut off at the roots.
To whom did this <i>cabelladuro d’or</i> belong? Some
beauty done to death, perhaps, or peacefully fallen
upon sleep in the dim, dim past? Or was it, as it
may have been, the <i>chevelure</i> of that beautiful young
Italian girl in the suite of Queen Jehanne, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
married at Les Baux the Queen’s Seneschal, and died
ere ever that day’s curfew sounded? The “<i>Pavillon
de la Royne Jehanne</i>,” with its miniature dome
and delicate frieze, supported on Ionic columns,
still stands, but hidden away amid cornstalks and
verdure, whilst, alas! nothing whatever remains of
the Queen’s gardens, where courtier cavaliers flirted
and toyed with her Maids of Honour. Jehanne loved
Les Baux almost as much as she did her Laval
barony of Beaufort, and René loved it, too, for
her sake.</p>

</div>

<p>Early in the springtide which followed the settlement
of the King and Queen in Provence, they
sought the peaceful charms of the country-side, and
made their way, accompanied by a very limited suite,
to the neighbourhood of Tarascon. The stately
castle, so lately René’s favourite abode, had little
attraction for ruralizing royalty, so they packed
themselves into a modest <i>bastide</i>, or farmstead, upon
the kingly estate, Pertuis, not far from Cadenet,
below Mont Lubéron. Its position was delightful,
overlooking the turbulent river Durance, with its
strewn verdure-grown rocks and boulders, and its
banks lined by sedges, willows, and alders, hiding
many a still pool of trout. There the royal couple
wandered forth hand in hand, quite unattended, amid
the growing vines and chestnut woods, conversing
with all the country-folk they met, sharing with
them their homely fare, and watching delightedly
their rural games and dances. Many a time René,
with Jehanne as his happy assessor, sat upon old
<i>saules</i>, or willow stumps, under a spreading tree, to
receive requests and discern disputes, dispensing royal
justice with the simple hand of equity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>The life they led was an ideal one&mdash;a dream, an
inspiring fantasy. The songs of birds, the brush of
wings of butterflies, the thousand and one mysterious
sounds of animated, sun-cheered Nature, and the
scent of spring narcissi, with the glowing glories of
anemones, seemed all to be in harmony with the
fresh greenery of tree and crop, the gambols of young
lambs, and the cooing of sweetheart doves. The
King and Queen became for the nonce shepherd
and shepherdess; Jehanne was nymph of the
bosquets, René her impassioned Apollo, his heart’s
wounds healed at last, his soul’s new hopes at bud.
The Muse of Poetry dwelt also in that pleasant
fairy-land, and her voice, rustling the zephyr-moved
foliage, reached the poetic nature of the agrestical
King, and out of his sympathetic brain came the
impulse of the hand which penned one of the most
delicate and affecting “Pastorals” that ever man
produced.</p>

<p>The scene is laid in the meadows of the royal
country house, where shepherds and shepherdesses
and toilers in the soil,&mdash;vigorous and fair,&mdash;are
giving themselves away to the joys of pastoral revels.
Chancing that way is a pilgrim, newly come from
recording his vows at the shrine of Nôtre Dame de
Larghet. Looking ahead, the penitent beholds the
entrancing vision, and, whilst he brushes away the
assiduous attentions of a big bumble-bee, he is conscious
of voices murmuring close at hand. It is but
the love-chat of a lovelorn lad and lass, seated by a
dripping fountain of the rivulet. Behind them is the
stump of a great forest king with no more than one
lean branch to show its life. The youth vanishes
mysteriously, but the girl beckons caressingly to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
wandering pilgrim, and she invites him with dulcet
voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Regnault, vien environ</div>
<div class="verse">De la souche; et nous asseon,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Cy toy et moy!”</div>
<div class="english">
<div class="verse">“Regnault, come thee near</div>
<div class="verse">This tree; have no fear,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Only thee and me!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The shy wanderer approaches diffidently, and then
the maiden opens her little luncheon basket, which
hangs from her shoulders by blue silken ribbons, and
eats a portion of a roll; to him she offers the
remainder. The fascination of the moment overrides
all scruples, and Regnault, as she has called him,
kneels at his enchantress’s feet, strokes her hands and
arms, and protests his love. The damsel is willy-nilly,
and naïvely cries: “All fall in love, and all
fall out; and so may you, fair sir, for aught I know!”
Carried away by the vehemence of his passion,
Regnault tries to seize the girl and press his hot
lips upon hers, so coral pink; but she evades him,
slips from his grasp, and, presto! she has vanished.
All dazy-wazy Regnault rises, holds out his hands
beseechingly, and then, folding them upon his breast,
with bowed head he seeks once more the mountain
shrine, and before our sweet Lady of Consolation
pours out his heart and his soul. Compline still finds
him saying his <i>Aves</i>, and Night covers him with her
restful shroud; his last words are addressed to his
meadow nymph:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“T’ameray très parfaictment,</div>
<div class="verse">Du bon du Cuer si loyaument,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Que ne te fauldray nullement</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Jusques à mort.”</div>
<div class="english">
<div class="verse">“I love thee perfectly,</div>
<div class="verse">From bottom of my heart;</div>
<div class="verse">I will never fail thee</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Till death us two shall part.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This very beautiful poem the royal lover entitled
“<i>Regnault et Jehanneton</i>,” or “<i>Les Amours du Bergier
et de la Bergeronne</i>,”&mdash;a play, of course, upon his
own name and Queen Jehanne’s. At the end of the
manuscript René drew a very pretty design&mdash;side by
side two shields of arms, his and Jehanne’s, united by
a royal crown; his supporter, on the left, <i>une souche</i>,&mdash;the
stump of a forest tree,&mdash;with one flourishing
foliaged branch bearing a censer of burning incense;
her supporter, on the right, a chestnut-tree in full
flower, and on a branch two royal paroquets&mdash;lovebirds!</p>

<p>In 1457 the poet-King put forth an allegory of
chivalry which he called “<i>La Conqueste de Doulce
Mercy par le Cuer d’Amour espris</i>.” The conceit of
the story is just a simple knight,&mdash;youthful,
vigorous, and a true lover of women,&mdash;setting forth
for the devotion he holds for his mistress to endure
perilous adventures. René himself is, of course, the
hero of the poem, the intrepid soldier of Naples, the
heroic prisoner of Bulgneville.</p>

<p>The opening of the poem reveals “<i>le Bon Roy</i>” one
night wakeful, and suffering heartache&mdash;“<i>Mortie
dormant en resverie</i>.” It appeared to him that his
heart left his breast, and that “<i>Vif Désire</i>” whispered
gently:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent4">“Si, Doulce Mercy,</div>
<div class="verse">Desires de povoir avoir,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Il fault que tu faces devoir</div>
<div class="verse">Par la force d’armes l’acquerir.”</div>
<div class="english">
<div class="verse indent4">“If, True Chivalry,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou wouldst have power,</div>
<div class="verse">Then thy metal try</div>
<div class="verse">And by arms acquire.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“<i>Vif Désire</i>” then armed “<i>Cuer</i>” with a blade
of steel, keen and bright, a helmet stamped with
amorous thoughts bearing the crest of hope, three
blooms of “<i>N’oubliez mye</i>.” Then led gently forth,
he meets “<i>Franc Vouloir</i>,” tall and strong, and
fully armed for all emergencies; and putting spurs to
his charger, he goes off at a gallop with his companions.
Over hill and dale they dash, until they
come in view of a lovely damsel&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent8">“plaiesante et blonde</div>
<div class="verse">Et de tous biens la plus parfaict du monde.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After passing through a weird forest, they emerge
upon a smiling valley, where they behold a sumptuous
palace. On approaching, they see a very splendid
column of jasper, and after dismounting they read
the inscription carved thereon:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“A vous, tous Cuers gentilz et gracieux,</div>
<div class="verse">Qui conquérir voulez pour valori mieulx</div>
<div class="verse">Du Dieu d’Amour et de vos Dames aussi</div>
<div class="verse">Doulce grace et eureuse mercy.</div>
<div class="verse">N’ayez en vous changement de pensée</div>
<div class="verse">Pour delaissier vos premières amours,</div>
<div class="verse">Soiez loyaux sans varier tousjours,</div>
<div class="verse">Pitie pur vous ne sera par lasée.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Whilst pondering over this epithet, a very beautiful
woman approaches them, splendidly attired in royal
robes, and seizes hold of the reins of “<i>Franc
Vouloir’s</i>” steed. “<i>Cuer</i>” at once turns to her, and,
kneeling, kisses her hand and asks her name.
“<i>Douce Éspérance</i>,” she replies, “and I greet you,
worthy gentlemen, and desire to set you on your
way.” Directed by this gracious lady, they reach t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>he
shores of a great lake or sea, and, moored by the
water’s edge, they espy a little sailing vessel, and in
it two lovely maidens&mdash;“<i>Fiance</i>” and “<i>Actente</i>”&mdash;about
whom “<i>Douce Éspérance</i>” had spoken.
Leaving their mounts to wander free, the travellers
board the frail craft, and, presto! they are at the
glorious temple of the Isle of Love. The day passes
dillydally; they all sup together, and the sweet, soft
shadows hide their repose. Other characters are
“<i>Bel Accueil</i>,” “<i>Franchise</i>,” “<i>Piété</i>,” “<i>Faux Semblant</i>,”
and “<i>Largesse</i>”; and the allegory ends, as all
should do, in the complete victory of Cupid.</p>

<p>The year that Louis XI., by his greed and
treachery, drove his noble uncle, “<i>le Bon Roy René</i>,”
out of Anjou was one of trial and embarrassment for
the King of Sicily. At first his feelings, outraged
by the infamous behaviour of the son of his best-loved
sister, Queen Marie, got the better of his
equanimity, and he gave way to indignant protests;
but when a man is in his sixties he learns to put up
with base affronts. René learned by sad experience
to measure hypocrites by their professions, but to
leave their castigation to posterity. He accepted
philosophically, adverse circumstances as they arose
and not only checked the expression of his own sentiments,
but discouraged reprisals on the part of his
impatient and indignant subjects. With this same
restraint the poet-King put forth a sententious
drama, which he entitled “<i>L’Abuzé en Court</i>”; we
may translate it, perhaps, “The Victim of Circumstances.”
Its theme may be gauged as follows:
Within the shady portal of an ancient church,&mdash;the
pavement strewn with the persons of the blind and
crippled seeking alms,&mdash;a pious wayfarer beheld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span> an
oldish man whose silken though shabby attire spoke
of better days. His doublet was torn and his long
poniard broken, his light brown hair streaked with
silver strands, and his pouch poorly furnished. The
wayfarer speaks kindly to the victim of Providence:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Mon gentil homme, Dieu vous garde,</div>
<div class="verse">Et vous doint ce que déseriez.</div>

<p>Then he goes on to tell his story&mdash;the story of his
life’s adversity, a biograph of René’s. In happy days,
now past, he had his amours and his ambitions, his
military exploits and his acts of peace. Much of his
time he had spent unselfishly caring for others, whose
weal depleted his purse and embarrassed his affairs
until he was forced to settle with his creditors. The
narrative is worked out in dialogue by the concourse
of many speakers&mdash;among them a great lady,
“<i>La Court</i>”&mdash;Providence, and two <i>demoiselles</i> of pity&mdash;“<i>Abuz</i>”&mdash;Wantoncy,
and “<i>Folcuideo</i>”&mdash;Mockery.</p>

erstwhile understood.</p>

<p>René and Jehanne went to Provence in 1473 in
the guise of fugitives. The Angevines deplored
excessively this exile; they loved both King and
Queen, and Louis and all his works they hated
cordially. René saw no other course to follow. He
was heavily cast down by family afflictions. Jean,
his noble eldest son, was dead; dead, too, were
Charles d’Anjou, his brother, and Nicholas, his dear
grandson, and Ferri de Vaudémont. He sought
peace and consolation, and Provence and the Provençaux
offered both most loyally.</p>

<p>The story of Louis’s perfidy may be shortly told.
In 1474 René proclaimed Charles de Maine, his
nephew, his heir to Anjou-Provence, regardless of
the French King’s presumptions. Louis summoned
his uncle to Paris to answer before the Parliament.
Something of a compromise was come to, for Louis
said he should be content for Charles to be proclaimed
Duke and Count, but after him he or his
heirs would annex both duchy and county to France.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>
<p>It had always been the policy of Sovereigns to
encourage knight-errantry and tournaments, for the
competitors who assembled became lieges of the lord.
The names and performances of candidates were
inscribed on parchment rolls with gold and enamels;
these were read out aloud by tabarded heralds. The
champions were escorted in pageants to be decorated
by the Queen or Lady President of the “Lists”&mdash;a
graduation, so to speak, in a world-wide University of
chivalry. In 1453 Duke Philippe of Burgundy
instituted a very singular festival, “The Pageant of
the Pheasant,” in which knights were made to swear
for Church and fame. The oath ran as follows:
“I <i>N.</i> swear before God, my Creator, in the first
place; the ever-glorious Mary, His mother; and,
lastly, before these ladies of the tournament and the
Pheasant, to be a true and Christian knight.” The
Pheasant was the emblem of fecundity, the mascot of
would-be brides and mothers!</p>

<p>Troubadours and “Courts of Love” were complements
of warlike deeds on stricken field or in tilting-joust.
The Provençal seigneurs and their ladies lived
in lonely castles, with nothing on earth to do.
Provence was the cradle of the troubadours. Every
troubadour had to choose the lady of his passion; she
might return it or not, as she chose. It was Guillaume
de Poitou, a very famous troubadour, who gave
the maxim: “If you propose a game of love, I am
not too foolish to refuse, but I shall choose the side
that is the best.” All this appealed to King René,
and his bent fell in distinctly with that of the famous
troubadours of the past. His poetic and sentimental
nature found reflective expression in the old “<i>Magali</i>,”
of the popular melodies of Provence:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“O Magali ma tant amado,</div>
<div class="verse">Mete la tête au fenestroun,</div>
<div class="verse">Esecuto un pan aguesto subado</div>
<div class="verse">De Tambourine, de Viouloun</div>
<div class="verse">Esplein estello paramount,</div>
<div class="verse">L’Auro os tournado</div>
<div class="verse">Mailes estello paliran</div>
<div class="verse">Quand te verraut.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This was the spirit of the life to which King René
introduced his young and beauteous consort&mdash;a
romantic existence which appealed forcibly to the
sweet instincts of the royal bride. Her response
was the joy of René’s heart; if denied the fruit of
sexual love, he and she were productive of the issue
of kindred souls. They lived for one another in an
elysium of bliss, chaste and unalloyed, with no
qualms of conscience and no aftermath of reproach.</p>

<p>René’s love of Jehanne became a passion; her
freshness and animation and the evenness of her disposition
were to him like so many springs of invigorating
water, whence, quaffing, he ever rose to new
activities. She became the inspirer of his poetry, the
spur in his official duties, and the pivot of his
benevolence. He was never tired of extolling her
virtues in prose and verse, nor of painting her in
miniature and in large. It was said that he always
carried about with him wherever he went her portrait,
which he himself painted upon a small oval piece of
walnut wood let into a locket frame of chiselled gold
and enamel. More than this, his most treasured
trophy of the “Lists”&mdash;the lance with which he
unseated Charles VII. at the nuptial tournament for
Queen Marguerite d’Anjou&mdash;contained an orifice
wherein he inserted another likeness of “<i>la bonne
Jehanne</i>.” In the inventory of his garderobe at
Angers Castle we read: “<i>Item, Ung bois de l<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>ance
creux, ou il y a dedans un rollet de parchemin,

<p><a name="Footnote_A_11" id="Footnote_A_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_11"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> “Item, A hollow lance pole wherein there is a roll of parchment
upon which is a portrait of the Queen of Sicily.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Comptes de Roi René</i>, filling very many
folios, wherein are noted household, State, and
private expenses and other correlative matters, were
stored in the <i>Chambre des Comptes</i> which René
caused to be built at Angers Castle. A suite of
apartments facing the river was used for the transaction
of business matters and for the deposit of
valuable documents. Here, too, was the King’s
council-chamber, whilst in the gardens stretching in
front along the river-side were cages and caves,
wherein were kept many lions and strange beasts
the collection of which became a royal hobby.
Beyond the spacious buildings at the centre of the
gardens was a pavilion which René used as a study
and a sanctum, wherein he spent much of his leisure
time dreaming, reading, and writing. Here he kept
a register of artists and artisans, noting their several
qualifications, their works, and their honorariums and
salaries. He had a sort of school of architect-surveyors
who, under his personal direction, prepared
plans and projections of all the works, public and
private, in which he was interested&mdash;markets, bridges,
fountains, cottages, etc.</p>

<p>A work at Angers in which he took the greatest
interest, and on which he lavished large sums of
money, was the erection and decoration of a chapel
within the Cathedral of St. Maurice, which he dedicated
to the ever-blessed memor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>y of St. Bernardin, his
cherished friend and confessor.</p>

<p>Giovanni della Porta was born at Massa di Carrara
at the close of 1384. He took the cord and cowl of
St. Francis d’Assisi, and was sent with other brethren
of the Order to evangelize the people of Marseilles.
He became attached to the household of King
Louis II., René’s father, and thus an intimacy sprang
up between the two. He accompanied René on all
his expeditions to Italy, and remained in priestly
attendance upon him when at home. The good man
died of fever at Aquila in Calabria in 1449, and
René, ever grateful to his mentor and spiritual father,
in 1450 prevailed upon Pope Nicholas V. to order
his canonization. Certain miracles said to have been
wrought at his tomb in Southern Italy, and weird
happenings as his body was translated to Anjou,
convinced the Curia of his sanctity. His memorial
chapel at Angers was a sumptuous erection, and in its
adornment the King took an active part, painting the
glass windows and the altar and its reredos. Before
the resting-place of the dead saint’s corpse René
directed a funeral chamber to be made, wherein he
subsequently ordered by his will that his heart should
be deposited. This was an action truly characteristic
of “<i>le bon Roy</i>.” He had so often unburdened himself
to the saint, and from him had obtained not only
absolution, but direction, that their two hearts beat
in accord in life, and in death they were also joined.</p>

<p>Not only did the heart of René rest near St. Bernardin,
but the hearts also,&mdash;each in its golden
casket,&mdash;of Jehanne and the valiant and chivalrous
Jean de Calabria, René’s eldest son.</p>

<p>King René and Queen Jehanne were pious folk
indeed. At Marseilles, at Tarascon, and at Aix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
itself, they assisted humbly at Church festivals, processions,
and pilgrimages. The lives and loves of
the humble home at Bethany in Palestine, transhipped
to the reverent shores of tuneful Provence,
kindled the affection and the reverence of one and
all. The feasts of “<i>Les Maries</i>,” St. Marthe de
Tarasque, and of St. Maximin, good Lazarus’s disciple,
were honoured by enthusiastic annual devotions.
No one tired of hearing of those saintly lives, and
no sacrifice was too great to show the heart’s devotion.
King René and his consort’s offerings took
the form of costly reliquaries in gold, enamels, and
jewels, depositories upon high-altars for holy relics.
The royal couple assisted at the translation of St.
Martha’s relics to Tarascon, May 10, 1458. In
1461 from Aix went a splendid casket to the
collegiate church of St. George at Nancy, in pious
memory of that redoubtable warrior and of the gentle
Isabelle de Lorraine. It was intended for the
encasement of a thigh-bone of the Knight of
Cappadocia. The King and Queen in 1473 presented
another precious reliquary to the Church of
St. Nicholas du Port at Angers, and with it they
bestowed upon the clergy the unique gift of an arm
and a hand of the saint. Twelve leagues from Aix is
the curious little town of St. Maximin, where, in the
thirteenth-century church,&mdash;built by Charles II. of
Naples and Provence, ancestor of Queen Giovanna II.,&mdash;are
preserved the sacred bones of St. Mary Magdalen.
The skull, it is said, has still a small fragment
of flesh adhering where Christ touched her forehead.
Here, too, the kingly couple bestowed a golden
reliquary for the saint’s right arm and founded a
perpetual Mass. This sad saint of Christ, the
repentant one, ever had great influence with Ren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>é
and his royal consort. Not content with listening
to her sweet voice,&mdash;perhaps an imagination, after
all,&mdash;in the streets of Marseilles (as the King himself
has depicted), in a beauteous retreat near Angers
he fixed a sweet shrine, La Baumette, or Bausome,
near Reculée, where he founded a hermitage, “La
Madeleine de St. Baumette.” This was partly in
honour of “St. Baume,” as the Magdalen, the
patroness of Provence was familiarly called. In the
chapel the King painted a picture of St. Bernardin
hearing confession&mdash;perhaps his own.</p>

<p>If René had lost the crown of Naples, another
crown was shortly laid at his feet. In 1469 the
Grand Council of Barcelona rejected Juan II. as
King of Catalonia. He was brother of Alfonso V.,
René’s rival and conqueror in Naples, but unpopular
and blind, and somewhat unready. His wife, the
courageous Queen Blanche of Navarre, had taken
his place in line of battle, and was enthusiastically
beloved by the Catalonians; she died, unhappily, in
1468, of a cancer or of poison, so it was rumoured,
and with her died the love of Juan’s subjects. The
vacant throne was offered with one accord to King
René of Sicily-Anjou, the son of the beloved and
venerated Princess Yolanda,&mdash;who had been brought
up at Barcelona,&mdash;the only child of old King Juan I.
René, in accepting the graceful tribute to his dear
mother’s claim and person, placed his son Jean de
Calabria in the hands of the Catalonians, and begged
them,&mdash;his own age being far advanced, and his son in
his prime and a famous warrior,&mdash;to proclaim him in
his stead. Jean was acclaimed generally, and hastened
to Barcelona to assume his crown, being backed by
Louis XI. with a money subsidy and a strong force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span> of
men. The landing of the new King was a scene of
uproarious rejoicing. His princely qualities appealed
to them, and his grandmother had been their own
Princess. People struggled to embrace his knees
as he rode to the castle; they kissed the harness of
his charger, and ladies tossed valuable rings and
jewellery with their flowers and their kisses sweet.</p>

<p>Alas for the joys of nations and of individuals!
when things are rosiest, and all tend to good and
peace and prosperity, there swoops down the insatiable
mower with his scythe, to garner what men can
least well spare. King Juan III. of Catalonia and
Calabria had not been installed in the kingdom of
his grandmother more than one short year, when he
fell ill of plague or poison,&mdash;the two fellest foes to
Sovereigns then,&mdash;and died at Barcelona on December
13, 1470. He had fought for his father’s
cause and his own right nobly in Italy, defeating
Ferdinand d’Aragon, Alfonso’s son, at Sarno in
1460, but, beaten at Troia, he fled to Ischia.</p>

<p>The Castle of Beaufort was built upon a lofty rock
rising above the Loire, overlooking the whole of that
fertile and lovely valley; from its battlements both
Angers and Saumur were visible. King René purchased
it and its estate in 1469 for 30,000 gold
crowns, and assigned it as part of Queen Jehanne’s
fortune. After the King’s death and burial, and
when she had taken a sad and affectionate farewell
of her devoted people in Provence, the royal widow
settled down in this attractive residence, and there
spent the residue of her life. The <i>Comptes</i> contain many
items for building materials, decoration, and furniture,
showing King René’s anxiety to make his dear wife’s
bijou residence a very real pleasaunce for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>René indeed was a master-builder, not merely in
the way of a hobby, but practically and in many
places. He studied the works of Leon Battista
Alberti and other famous architects, and entertained
and employed numbers of Italian sculptors. Pietro
da Milano was one of these; he was engaged principally
in Barrois, and there added the duties of
director of revels to his other artistic occupations.
Marble busts of René and Jehanne, of Queen
Margaret of England and her unhappy son Edward,
Prince of Wales, of Ferri de Vaudémont and Yolande,
with their young son René, and many others, found
expression under Pietro’s skilful chisel. In the
“<i>Farce des Pastoureaux</i>,” acted at the Palace of
Bar-le-Duc in August, 1463, King René provided
costly dresses for his clever little namesake grandson,
then twelve years old, and for the rest of the juvenile
cast; these were made by Noel Bontault, after
Pietro da Milano’s designs. The King and his
Court were then in residence at the Castle of Louppy,
which he had repaired along with the castles of
Clermont en Argonne, de Koeurs, and Bonconville,
and where he received and comforted his miserable
daughter, the heroic consort of Henry VI. Queen
Jehanne’s ministrations to the forlorn Queen were
tenderly rendered and gratefully received. She is
credited with the characteristically graceful acts of
reclothing the fugitive, and according to Queen
Margaret precedence and homage. King René’s
handiwork in all these enterprises was varied and
extensive. He painted the windows, he carved
the escutcheons of arms, and he fashioned the
hinges and locks of the doors. The <i>Comptes</i>
prove by very many entries his royal excellence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span> as a
craftsman as well as an artist. Scarcely a church in
Barrois, Lorraine, Anjou, and Provence, but bore
evidence of the kingly artistry. Perhaps his two
specialities were glass working and decorating, and
wool and silk weaving and embroidery.</p>

<p>One of the most admirable works of the King and
Queen,&mdash;for Jehanne was not only the amanuensis of
her husband, but his inspirer also,&mdash;was the conception
and the elaboration of the procession of the
“<i>Fête Dieu</i>” and “<i>Les Jeux de la Tarasque</i>.” This
pageant originated in the mind of René when, as a
youth, he witnessed with emotion in 1427, at Bar-le-Duc,
“<i>La Mystère de la Passion</i>,” under the direction
of Conrad Bayer, Bishop of Metz. Thirty years of
war and travel did not banish the impression the
young Christian warrior gained, and from time to
time in Anjou and elsewhere he composed <i>rondeaux</i>,
<i>ballades</i>, and <i>chansons</i>, in a masque or mystery which
he called “<i>Le Roy Avenir</i>.” In 1474 the King and
Queen assisted at Aix at the first rendition of “<i>Les
Jeux de la Fête Dieu</i>.” This was preceded by “<i>La
Procession du Sacré</i>”&mdash;the Procession of the Sacred
Host. All the clergy, nobles, troubadours, pretty
women, and gallant knights, of Provence assisted, and
all the trade corporations took part. Everybody in
the procession carried upon the tip of a white wand
a piece of <i>pain béni</i>. Each section of the cortège
was a moving spectacle or pageant. The first section,
by acclamation, exhibited “<i>Lon Grand Juée deis
Diables</i>”&mdash;the Grand Play of the Devils. The devils
were black and red and green, and every youth’s
ambition was to figure as a Prince of Darkness;
indeed, in later times a young fellow based his claim
to be a devil on the fact that his father and all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
ancestors had been devils, so “<i>c’est pourquoi ne le
serrais je pas!</i>”</p>

<p>To “the Devils” succeeded “the Magi,” “the
Innocents of Bethlehem,” “the Apostles,” “the
Queen of Sheba and Solomon,” and other <i>tableaux
movants</i> from Scriptural sources. Most amusing were
“The Play of the Jews,” represented by human cats&mdash;a
reference to the features characteristic of the
race; “<i>Les Chevaux fringants</i>,” hobby-horses
played by four-and-twenty children, dressed as
knights of the “Lists”; a masque of morris-dancers.
The two last spectacles were lugubrious: “The Company
of Lepers” and “The March of Death.”</p>

<p>The revels filled five whole days in and out of
church, through and through the streets and squares,
and out into the open pleasure-grounds. Prizes were
awarded, honours bestowed, and profits made, and
everybody was the better for the prodigality of “<i>le
bon Roy</i>” and the graciousness of “<i>la bonne Royne</i>.”</p>

<p>René had been in early life remarkable for his
simple tastes and abstemiousness in food and drink,
and Queen Isabelle was equally careful in personal
matters. Their lives were passed in strenuous times
when self-denial required great sacrifices of individual
indulgences. Isabelle was a soldier’s wife, Jehanne
the consort of a statesman when life’s battle had
given way to the ease of peace. Both were attractive
women, few their superiors, but Isabelle’s hand was
upon the hilt of the sword and the snaffle of the
charger. Jehanne’s held the mirror of fashion and
the goblet of pleasure. After René and Jehanne
had arranged their domestic settlement in Provence,
at once their Court became noted for its magnificent
hospitality. René employed the first master-cook of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the day, Maestro Guillaume Real, as his Master of
the Household. People nicknamed him “<i>Courçon</i>,”
as marshal of the courses of a banquet, rather than
“<i>Soupçon</i>,” the secret of each! The royal repasts were
arranged as spectacles; at the cross high table were
placed the hosts and guests of honour, and at tables
down the hall other guests were accommodated. The
walls were hung with silver and crystal sconces full
of torches or tapers, and the trophies of war and the
chase belonging to the house were there displayed.
The covers and the service were as rich and costly
as could be. Gold, enamels, crystals, rare faience,
and other art treasures, were used with lavish
taste.</p>

<p>Each course was proclaimed heraldically by blasts
of horns and <i>motets</i> from the music gallery. The
high table was served by knights and men of rank,
who bore the splendid bowls and dishes upon napery
of cloth of gold. The richer viands were enclosed in
golden caskets, and the keys offered to the guests,
who in turn unlocked them and took or refused their
contents. Some of the confections have not their
parallel to-day. One table, for example, was made to
represent a stag-hunt, another a village revel, one
a castle with a moat of rare vintage, another an
abbey church with bells pealing and hidden children
singing. Small animals and birds, and actually growing
trees and flowers, were used. The roast and
the dessert were the <i>pièces de résistance</i>; each was
carried up the hall in gay procession with much
ceremonious bowing, and guarded by archers of the
guard in gorgeous liveries. At the sight of any very
splendid and appealing course the whole lordly
company were wont to burst out into song&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span> well-known
and lengthy <i>chanson</i>; it was called “<i>Le
Sauve-garde de ma Vie</i>.”</p>

<p>Over the anticlimax of the feast the kindly
chroniclers usually draw a discreet veil, for warriors
in the field were vanquished in the hall, and beauties
beloved in the boudoir were forgotten in the debauch.
We may suppose rightfully, however, that the
hospitalities of René and Jehanne never caused a
flush of shame or a prick of scorn. They aimed at
and happily succeeded in proving that “<i>il n’y pas au
monde de royauté comparable au bonheur d’être aimé
d’elle</i>,” as the King prettily termed it.</p>

<p>For twenty-five years the simple delights of a
useful domestic life were serenely enjoyed by the happy
King and Queen. Their spirit of contentedness
hallowed the homes of their people, and Provence
became a paradise of peace. Certainly the want of
children caused Jehanne many a pang, but the
devotion of a good husband, one so accomplished, so
unselfish, and so universally beloved, was a real
compensation, and she had learned the lesson of
mingled weal and woe. She found congenial occupation
in furthering the good intentions of the King
and in ministering to all in need around her. She
had, nevertheless, quasi-maternal cares, for in the
palace at Aix and in other royal residences were
several children and young people of both sexes,
besides the three acknowledged bastards by convention,
who could lay claim to royal parentage. Some
of these are mentioned in <i>Les Comptes</i> as receiving
alimony and gifts from René. An entry on July 8,
1466, records the gift to Demoiselle Odille of a
pelisse of marten fur. She was then somewhere about
twenty years of age, but had charge of the King’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
rings and jewellery under the eye of Sieur Guillaume
de Remerville, the Treasurer of the Household.
René had married her, in 1460, to Gaspare Spinola,
a Genoese attendant in his train, who died in 1465,
leaving his child-widow to the care of her father.
Another child is also named, Hélène,&mdash;“<i>la petite
Hélène</i>,” as René called her,&mdash;an attractive little
creature, “singing like a lark and dancing like a
gazelle,” who died on her fifteenth birthday, in the
year 1469. The King liked to have her near him
at meal-times, when he fondled her affectionately,
“<i>comme ma vraie fille</i>.”</p>

<p>Besides these family cares, Queen Jehanne devoted
much of her time to feminine industries. In the
convents, in the workshops, in the fields, were poor
girls and women needing assistance and encouragement.
The example of “good Queen Yolande” was
ever before her eyes, and she strove to make herself
not only mistress of their hearts, but of their
occupations. Spinning, weaving, embroidering, and
generally all needlework, found her an accomplished
executant. She, too, could use her brush and palette,
in miniature and in large, and her chisel and mallet
both in wood and stone, and she was a very excellent
artificer in gold and silver work. Her benefactions
were on the most liberal and most catholic scale; no
good cause was overlooked, and when she came to
make her will, paragraph after paragraph was taken
up by bequests to charitable institutions and to
cherished needy individuals. If less devout than
her sister-in-law, Queen Marie, and less religiously
exercised, Queen Jehanne was a model daughter of
the Church, and none recognized this more completely
than His Holiness the Pope, who bestowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
upon her the precious decoration of the Golden
Rose, “for virtue as a spouse and benevolence as
a Queen.”</p>

<p>Approaching her jubilee,&mdash;an anxious period for
many women,&mdash;the good Queen fell away in health,
and appeared to be sickening for her end. Poison
was hinted at, but in all probability she suffered, not
from poison designedly administered, but from the
poison of the atmosphere, laden time out of mind,
in those low-lying lands near the mouths of the
Rhine, with the seeds of disease&mdash;the dreaded plague
and black-death.</p>

<p>Happily, Jehanne was able, through her robust
constitution and abstemious way of life, to throw off
the evil effects of her malady; but no sooner had she
regained her accustomed vigour than a crushing sorrow
came to her&mdash;the mortal illness of her cherished
spouse, King René. His was a green old age, with
his venerable but erect figure and his winning if
somewhat melancholy expression. His blue eyes and
gracious aspect drew forth confidence all round, and
his gentle voice and genial manners excited true
affection. Dressed almost with monkish severity in
a great long coat of black silk or velvet, with a heavy
collar and revers of brown squirrel fur, and wearing a
girdle with a crucifix and beads, his long white hair
was capped by a simple velvet <i>berretta</i>, and he
displayed neither jewels nor decorations, only his
Sovereign’s badge and chain of gold. He was a typical
father of his people.</p>

<p>Struck down mysteriously one day at Mass in the
Cathedral of Aix by a stalking epidemic,&mdash;he had not
spared himself in visits of condolence to the stri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>cken
and bereaved,&mdash;in the springtide of 1480, the King
was borne tenderly to the palace. No more tender
nurse could there be than his devoted consort. She
took her station at once at his bedside, and, laying her
head upon his pillow, she cheered and solaced him as
none other could; only did she rouse herself for
needful ablutions, for food, and for the saying of the
“Hours” in the oratory. With her was a little
maiden, René’s grandchild Marguerite, thirteen years
of age, Yolande de Vaudémont’s daughter, a great
pet of Queen Jehanne. The child had the sweetest
of sweet voices,&mdash;a quality very precious in the
estimation of the King,&mdash;and she soothed his sufferings
and refreshed his weaknesses by childish songs
and minstrelsy, whilst she stroked his withered hands
and in them placed her own.</p>

<p>At dawn of day, July 10, amid the rustling of the
summer foliage outside the wide-open windows of the
palace, came whisperings from the sick-room&mdash;soft,
low, and sad: “<i>Le bon Roy est mort!</i>” It was gently
told to the weeping Queen by the royal physicians, but
her Ladies of Honour in the anteroom caught the
ominous news besides. They stole outside the heavy
arras and told the terrible secret to the valets and
men-at-arms; then it flashed out through the galleries
and across the courtyards, and stayed the janitors of
the gates as they prepared to open them as usual for
the new day’s life. “<i>Le bon Roy est mort!</i>” soon was
echoed through the city streets, and tears and protestations
of affection and tender souvenirs of regret
found full utterance. “<i>Le bon Roy is mort!</i>” was
like the knell of doom. No one could realize it or
prophesy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>
<h3>III.</h3>

<p>No one has told us of Queen Jehanne’s sorrow&mdash;better
so. No stranger ever shares a full heart’s
loss. Broken, but submissive and self-sustained, her
consort’s fortitude in distress had come to her as well;
she failed not at the moment of her trial. With her
own hands she led the last offices of reverent duty to
the dead. Shrouded in a simple white linen shift,
but covered with the crimson and ermine mantle of
state, they laid their deceased Sovereign upon the
canopied bed of Estate, moved to the centre of the
great hall. The Queen herself had closed his eyes,
and now she arranged his hands. In them she placed
a costly ruby cross he had given her at her marriage;
at his feet she laid the “<i>Livre des Heures</i>,” which
was also his nuptial gift; and then she placed around
his neck the Sovereign’s jewel,&mdash;there was no heir to
wear it, alas!&mdash;and last of all she knelt and sprinkled
holy water on his corpse.</p>

<p>Every door and window was set wide ajar that,
night or day, all might see and pray and bless. Dusk
fell on that long, long day, but the crowd of loving
servants and subjects still surged along reverently to
pay their last respects; and so night fell and passed,
not in the peaceful hush of slumber, but with
smothered tread of painful feet and the smothered
sob of woe.</p>

<p>All Aix was hung in black, and on July 14 the
streets were lined by weeping citizens as the funeral
cortège of “<i>le bon Roy</i>” passed to the Cathedral of
St. Sauveur. The burial casket, after the requiem
and Court ceremonies, was placed, not in a tomb
direct, but in a <i>chapelle ardente</i>, and watches of
religious mounted guard and prayed. Soon the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>wish
of their venerated Sovereign was made public property,
and then, amid fresh lamentations lest Aix
should lose his remains, appeals were made to Queen
Jehanne. She was deeply affected, but remained
quiet and resigned. She could not reverse her
husband’s will, but she could allow his body to
remain awhile where it was. With this the authorities
had to be content, and forthwith, to strengthen
their hold upon that sacred casket, steps were
taken to erect a splendid monument and tomb. An
embassy was sent off at once to Rome to ask for a
“Bull” whereby the late Sovereign’s directions as to
the place of sepulture might be laid aside. Aix was
not so much jealous of Angers as she was devoted to
her King.</p>

<p>In accordance with the marital customs of the
time, King René had a mistress&mdash;perhaps more than
one, but one at least whose name has been preserved
by chroniclers, Marie de la Chapelle, a respectable
middle-class woman of Provence. Whether “de
la Chapelle” was a sobriquet or not is not clear;
probably it was so, and given her later on in life
after the artist King had painted her wearing a
<i>chapelle</i>, or black velvet hood, in a diptych, wherein
he faces her, which he kept secretly in his own
studio. It is said that she did not really love René,
but liked to rule him and to direct the royal household.
She was exigeant, too, for the legitimatizing
of the three children she bore the King, whom René
had always duly acknowledged as his. These were
Jean, “<i>le Bâtard d’Angers</i>,” created, after the
premature death of Prince Louis, Marquis de Pont-à-Mousson
and Seigneur of St. Cannot; Blanche; and
Madeleine. Jean married Isabelle, daughter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span> Raymond
de Glandevez, Ambassador to the Pope, pro-Governor
of Genoa, and Grand Master of France.
Blanche d’Anjou married Bertrand de Beauvau,
Seigneur de Precigny, Master of the Court of Angers
and Seneschal of Anjou. He was in 1462 appointed
President of Provence. His father was Seigneur de
Rochette. René gave his daughter the estate of
Mirabeau in Poitou, which he purchased in 1488.
In the <i>Comptes du Roy René</i> is the record of a
gift to Blanche of a gold mirror worth 20 <i>écus d’or</i>,
under date January 12, 1488, and the same year, on
March 18, she received a large table diamond from
her father, which unfortunately she lost when playing
in a farce before the Court on the following <i>Jour de
l’An</i>. The precious bauble was found by a monk,
Alfonso de la Rocque, Prior of the monastery of Les
Anges d’Aix, and restored on payment of a tun of red
wine. The discovery was only made known, it
appears, through the confessional; the good friar
had qualms about not making known his find. This
Blanche d’Anjou was educated at Beaucaire by Demoiselle
Collette, a worker in furs, who received many
costly gifts from King René. It has been sought to
prove that Marie de la Chapelle was this Demoiselle
Collette. Among the King’s gift were homely objects,
too. His <i>Comptes</i>, under April 4, 1447, record
“three cannes of fine holland cloth; two ditto fine
muslin, and five black silk velvet for a head-dress.”
Another gift to Blanche d’Anjou, on May 16, 1447,
was hair for a <i>rigotter</i>, a <i>coiffure postiche</i> for which the
King paid 7 florins to Marguerite, wife of Jehan
Augier, at Beaucaire. Again Blanche was the
recipient of her father’s generosity, for on June 7
the same year he gave her a cincture of wrought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
silver which cost 11 florins.</p>

<p>Before Blanche married the Seigneur de Precigny
he had buried three wives, and he himself was buried
with them at Angers in October, 1474. She died
prematurely in giving birth to a child, April 11,
1470, no more than twenty-one years of age. Madeleine,
René’s second illegitimate daughter, married
Louis Jehan, Seigneur de Belleneve, Chamberlain to
Charles VIII. of France when Dauphin. He gave
him for his marriage 15,000 florins, that he might
“espouse worthily <i>ma cousine</i>,” as he calls her.
Louis XII. gave her on her widowhood a sum of
12,000 florins.</p>

<p>On the death of King René, his eldest daughter,
Yolande, Countess of Vaudémont, claimed and assumed
the title of Queen of Sicily, Jerusalem, Naples, and
Aragon, but took no steps to enforce her claim upon
that vulture monarch, Louis XI., who at once seized
upon the lands of his uncle, and styled himself Duke
of Anjou and Count of Provence. Countess Yolande
was her father’s child, tender and retiring. She
craved the charms of the quiet life, and consequently,
at the convocation of the Estates of Anjou and
Provence, she renounced her title, and made it over
to her son René. He had already taken up the
gauntlet of his grandfather, and given proof of the
sterling qualities of his ancestry. The duchy of
Lorraine and that of Bar were his through his
mother also, and as Duke of Lorraine René II. is
known to historians. Countess Yolande died at
Nancy February 21, 1483. René II. was the
Prince whom his father, Ferri de Vaudémont, insisted
should make a pilgrimage from Vezelay,&mdash;famous in
the history of Thomas à Becket,&mdash;the capital <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>of Le
Morvan, to Jerusalem with one foot booted, the other
bare, and, as he went, to distribute to every poor
person he met 12 <i>livres</i> by way of satisfaction for
small sums he himself had borrowed and had not paid
back&mdash;surely a wide stretch of fatherly authority and
the law of substitution!</p>

<p>The widowed Queen lost little time in settling her
affairs in Provence, for she was minded to go to
Anjou with her precious dead; indeed, René had
expressed a wish to that effect. She carefully surveyed
the names of all the people René loved and of
those who loved him most nearly too. To each and
all some token was sent or given; she spared few
things for herself. Churches, institutions, schools,
guilds, and all public bodies, received mementoes of
the dead monarch. To Jehanne came many pangs at
parting. She had learned to love the gentle Provençals,
and they had not failed to return her regard
most warmly. At last her preparations were completed,
and she spent a day and night in the cathedral
by the casket of her dear dead, and then sorrowfully
she took her journey to distant Anjou, home to her
kith and kin.</p>

<p>King René in his will speaks thus of his beloved
Queen: “Because Jehanne has loved me, so I do
and shall love her as my dearest wife till death. Her
virtues and her goodness to me I cannot forget, nor
her loving services which she has rendered me for so
long a time. I will that she shall have unrestricted
liberty of action to settle, when I am dead, where she
will.… I give to her the county of Beaufort; the
castle and estate of Mirabeau; the town of Aubagne;
the castles of San Remy, Pertuis, and Les Baux,
with my <i>bastides</i> in and about Aix and at Mars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>eilles,
with all their furniture and appurtenances.” King
René also specially bequeathed to Jehanne his most
valuable jewels: collars of diamonds; “<i>le grand et le
petit bulay</i>,” rubies, with sprays of gold and gems;<a name="FNanchor_A_12" id="FNanchor_A_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_12" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
his diamonds “<i>à la cesse</i>,” uncut and strung (?); his
plates and caskets of gold; his great bowls of gold;
his great trays of silver; and his precious goblet and
ewer of gold encrusted with jewels; and many other
splendid precious objects.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_12" id="Footnote_A_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_12"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> “<i>Le grand bulay</i>” was a famous ruby, richly mounted, which he
had bought for 18,000 florins (= £7,000).</p>

</div>

<p>With respect to the body of King René, it has
been chronicled that the Queen before leaving Aix
made secret arrangements for its translation to
Angers. She feared a hostile demonstration if open
measures were taken. She took into her confidence
a priest belonging to the cathedral chapter, and they
together worked out a plan which was put into
operation after Queen Jehanne had arrived at
Angers. She sent two of her most trusty attendants,
Jehan de Pastis and Jacquemain de Mahiers,
with an imposing suite, conveying a letter to the
Archbishop of Aix asking for the heart of René.
The priestly confidant was at the service of the
envoys, and they very cleverly contrived to secrete
the casket with the King’s body in a royal chariot
which the Queen had commanded to be laden with
certain dresses and properties she had left behind, and
in particular the pall she had worked with her own
hand, and which was still covering the dead King’s
coffin. The precious burden was driven to a secluded
backwater of the Rhone, and there embarked upon a
great royal barge; and so King René’s body passed
through France once more, as he had so often done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
in life. The disembarkment of the royal corpse was
effected at Ponts-de-Cé, across the Loire, a few miles
out of Angers, and thence the second obsequies were
conducted with splendid ceremonies and amid universal
tokens of joy and sorrow of his Angevine subjects.
The heart was with the body, but the entrails were
left at Aix in the cathedral.</p>

<p>This was the last public appearance of Queen
Jehanne. She retired to her Castle of Beaufort, and
there she spent the residue of her life, eighteen long
and solitary years&mdash;years never idle, never self-indulgent,
years loyal to the fond memory of her
spouse, years yearning for reunion. The day Jehanne
entered her new home was St. Luke’s festival, 1481,
the second summer of the year, when the last grapes
hang ripened upon the vines, and the year’s vintage
is gathered in. Perhaps the simile from Nature
enforced itself upon the widowed Queen’s sympathetic
mind. Her harvest was now that of the quiet eye;
its growth had been when eye met eye&mdash;hers and
René’s; now was approaching the winter of her life,
when her work was to be finished and her rest full-garnered.</p>

<p>Jehanne chose as the companions of her widowhood
three trusty servitors&mdash;René de Breslay, her
Seneschal; Thibault de Cossé, her Master of the
Household; and Bernard de Praneas, her Confessor.
She spent her time in prayer and charity. She
established hostels for poor people, for pilgrims and
the sick; schools for children left orphans, and for
those cast upon the world by miserable parents.
Besides these pious works, the good Queen preserved
her interest in such arts and crafts as she and René
had encouraged in Provence. She studied once <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>more
books and sciences he had loved, she painted
miniatures, composed madrigals and hymns, and sang
and played as she had done for him, and her pen
became that of the ready writer. She translated
Guillaume de Guillerville’s tragedy, “The Pilgrimage
of Human Life”; “The Soul separated from the
Body,” a poem by Jehan Galoppez, a priest of
Angers and her Private Secretary; and a moralization
upon “The Certainty of Paradise.” All her
works were, however, in prose, which, she said
“<i>conservez le sens et les images, mais déliverez moi
du martelage et des grimaces de ce baragouin!</i>”<a name="FNanchor_A_13" id="FNanchor_A_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_13" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_13" id="Footnote_A_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_13"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> “Preserve the sense and the shape, but protect me from forced
metaphor and gibberish!”</p>

</div>

<p>Perhaps the action which most endeared the
memory of the good Queen to the hearts and minds
of the people about her was the extraordinary pains
she took to alleviate taxation and to readjust tribute.
When René took over the estate in 1471, he made
vast reductions in the imposts on land and stock
and crop. These were confirmed by Queen Jehanne
ten years later, and further reductions were conceded.
Her plea to herself was: “Now René is no more, I
have no other rôle to play but to do as he would have
wished me.” The Forest of Beaufort, where René
and she had followed the chase in princely fashion,
now no longer echoed the blast of hunting-horns and
the cracks of hunting-whips, but with the gentle
notes of the <i>Angelus</i>, and when the curfews rang out in
neighbouring village and homestead, they carried
with them the refrain, “<i>Priez pour la bonne
Jehanne</i>.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>
<p>These soft nocturnes and sweet visions of ancient
days still linger in Anjou. The memory of the
Queen of Sicily, Jehanne, is cherished, and almost
a proverb it has become, that all good things done in
that rich province are due to the watchful spirit
of the Queen. In this connection a very weird
narrative may be told. In 1469 Guillaume de
Harancourt, Bishop of Verdun, invented a cage of
wood and iron for refractory criminals. One such
was sent to Angers, which after Jehanne’s death
became known as the “cage of the Queen of Sicily.”
It was said that Jehanne had been put therein
wearing wooden sabots. The why and wherefore of
her incarceration was perfectly uncertain, but the
sabots are to-day in Angers Museum; the cage has
disappeared. Another version has it that King
René had among his wild creatures at Reculée and
elsewhere a very ferocious eagle which he could not
tame, and so the bird was sent to Angers and placed
in the Bishop’s wood and iron cage, and dubbed
“<i>La Reine</i>”&mdash;“The Queen”! This bird of prey
deserved the name; its appetite was prodigious. In
<i>Les Comptes</i>, among other entries referring to
“her Majesty,” is&mdash;“June 3, 1474, ‘La Reine’
has a whole sheep day by day.” This is quaint
indeed, but characteristic of stories and storytellers!</p>

<p>Queen Jehanne died at the Castle of Beaufort,
December 19, 1498,&mdash;as the chroniclers tell us,&mdash;“in
the odour of sanctity and with all the consolations
of Holy Church.”</p>

<p>The Queen’s will&mdash;a most lengthy document&mdash;contains
many affecting and many quaint bequests.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
She first of all commends herself conventionally to
the Almighty, and then goes on to indicate her desire
to be laid not far from “Marie of blessed memory”&mdash;her
consort’s grandmother, Marie de Blois-Châtillon&mdash;“before
the altar where is laid my lord and
consort,” and she warns all and sundry against
laying any other bodies there. Her heart she
bequeaths to the Chapel of St. Bernardin, within
the Church of the Cordeliers at Angers, to be placed
beside that of René. She directs that her body
shall be covered with a pall of black silk, and that at
her funeral six poor religious should attend habited
in black, and each bearing a flaming torch. Her
heart and René’s should repose upon a pall of cloth
of gold embroidered in crimson, and bearing their
joined shields of arms. Lights shall always burn in
front of the tomb and the cardial reliquary. She
instructs her brother and nephew, Seigneurs de la
Roche and de Montafiland, to hand over to the
Chapter of St. Maurice in Angers 200 <i>livres
tournois</i> (<i>circa</i> £120) to pay for her burial cortège,
and for Mass, absolutions, vespers, and bells. Particularly
she notes her preference for flags of <i>bougran</i>&mdash;stuff
(?)&mdash;over silken banners.</p>

<p>The day after her interment the Queen directs
that with reverent ritual a crown shall be placed
over her head like that she placed over René’s, upon
their monument. Certain saintly relics which he
and she had been the means of rescuing from sacrilege,
and had deposited in the Church of St. Tugal de
Laval, shall be displayed gratuitously to “such <i>dames
comtesses</i> as may wish to become mothers.” Her
“Breviary,” “Psalter,” “Hours,” and other books
of devotion, she bequeaths to the Church of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
Tugal de Laval, for the use of daughters of her
father’s house at their marriage or when residing
in Laval. Two gold rings she particularly desires
to be placed upon the relics of St. Nicholas d’Angers,
within his reliquary: “one, my wedding-ring, which
my very redoubtable lord and consort,&mdash;whom God
absolve,&mdash;placed upon my finger at our nuptials,
with a small heart of diamonds and enamelled with
deep red roses.” The other ring had a large diamond
mounted on a fleur-de-lis, and the band bore the
enamelled arms of Anjou. Queen Jehanne did not
forget her friends and attendants; for example,
among very many legacies, she left 200 <i>livres tournois</i>
each to three ladies: Jacqueline de Puy du Jour,
Catherine Beaufilz, and “<i>ma petite</i>” Gindine de
la Jaille, to provide them with trousseaux upon
marriage.</p>

<p>The body of the Queen was reverently shrouded
in a plain linen chemise, such as that with which she
herself had assisted to cover King René’s corpse, and
over it was placed his robe of state. Hers was the
last lying in state of a Queen of Sicily, and every
mark of homage and respect was rendered her
remains by high and low. Peasants and citizens
conspired together to show their grateful sense of
her virtues and her benefactions, and the country
road from Beaufort to Angers was lined with sympathetic
crowds of mourners. Her passing was in
the night time,&mdash;so consonant with her love of
seclusion and simplicity,&mdash;and the whole country-side
was ablaze with torches and bonfires. The
Queen’s burial was at St. Maurice’s Cathedral, in
the tomb of her consort; whilst her heart,&mdash;“so full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
of love and so tenderly beloved,”&mdash;in a golden casket
exactly like that of the King, was placed next his in
the Chapel of St. Bernardin. Upon a memorial
tablet was inscribed the epitaph: “Here lies the
Heart of the very high and puissant Princess,
Jehanne de Laval, second wife of King René, and
daughter of Guy, Count de Laval.”</p>

<p>The monument to King René, which she at last
came to share in blessed memory, had his effigy
reclining, and at his feet a sculptured lion, symbol
of courage; at Jehanne’s feet were carved two
hounds, emblematic of fidelity. The Chapel of
St. Bernardin thus became the royal mausoleum of
the last Anjou dynasty&mdash;René, with his father and
mother, his two wives, his eldest son, and his two
daughters, in holy company; and so they remained
for 300 years, until that cataclysmatic year 1793,
when every holy stone was tumbled down and every
reverent memorial defaced. The memorial chapel
was for centuries a thing of beauty. King René
himself painted the glass windows and designed the
tomb. Soon after his marriage with Jehanne de
Laval he employed Francesco Laurana and Pietro da
Milano to decorate the chapel.</p>

<p>Soon after the death of King René, Sieur Guillaume
de Remerville,&mdash;his Treasurer at Aix,&mdash;voiced the
universal sorrow and permanent regret of all the
royal servants of his lord in a beautiful funeral ode,
which he dedicated to “Queen Jehanne, his worshipful
mistress”:</p>

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
